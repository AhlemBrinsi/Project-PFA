      "Mayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations. Stress getting to you? Try some of these tips for stress relief. Is stress making you angry and grouchy? Stress relievers can help bring back calm and peace to your busy life. You don't have to put a lot of time or thought into stress relievers. If your stress is getting out of control and you need quick relief, try one of these tips. Almost any form of physical activity can act as a stress reliever. Even if you're not an athlete or you're out of shape, exercise can still be a good stress reliever. Physical activity can pump up your feel-good endorphins and other natural neural chemicals that boost your sense of well-being. Exercise also can refocus your mind on your body's movements. This refocus can improve your mood and help the day's irritations fade away. So go on a walk, take a jog, work in your garden, clean your house, bike, swim, weight train, vacuum or do anything else that gets you active. Eating a healthy diet is an important part of taking care of yourself. Aim to eat many fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Some people may deal with stress with unhealthy habits. These may include drinking too much caffeine or alcohol, smoking, eating too much, or using illegal substances. These habits can harm your health and increase your stress levels. During meditation, you focus your attention and quiet the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can help both your emotional well-being and your overall health. Meditation can empower us to enhance our well-being. You can practice guided meditation, guided imagery, mindfulness, visualization and other forms of meditation anywhere at any time. For example, you could meditate when you're out for a walk, riding the bus to work or waiting at your health care provider's office. Try an app to show you how to do these exercises. And you can try deep breathing anywhere. A good sense of humor can't cure all ailments. But it can help you feel better, even if you have to force a fake laugh through your grumpiness. When you laugh, it lightens your mental load. It also causes positive physical changes in the body. Laughter fires up and then cools down your stress response. So read some jokes, tell some jokes, watch a comedy or hang out with your funny friends. Or give laughter yoga a try. When you're stressed and irritable, you may want to isolate yourself. Instead, reach out to family and friends and make social connections. Even one good friend who listens can make a difference. Social contact is a good stress reliever because it can offer distraction, give support, and help you put up with life's up and downs. So take a coffee break with a friend, email a relative or visit your place of worship. Got more time? Try volunteering for a charity and help yourself while helping others. You might want to do it all, but you can't, at least not without paying a price. Learning to say no or being willing to delegate can help you manage your to-do list and your stress. Healthy boundaries are important in a wellness journey. Everyone has physical and emotional limits. Saying yes may seem like an easy way to keep the peace, prevent conflicts and get the job done right. But instead, it may cause you inner conflict because your needs and those of your family come second. Putting yourself second can lead to stress, anger, resentment and even the wish to take revenge. And that's not a very calm and peaceful reaction. Remember, you're a priority. With its series of postures and breathing exercises, yoga is a popular stress reliever. Yoga brings together physical and mental disciplines that may help you reach peace of body and mind. Yoga can help you relax and ease stress and anxiety. Try yoga on your own or find a class — you can find classes in many areas. Hatha yoga, especially, is a good stress reliever because of its slower pace and easier movements. Stress can cause you to have trouble falling asleep. When you have too much to do — and too much to think about — your sleep can suffer. But sleep is the time when your brain and body recharge. Most adults need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. And how well and how long you sleep can affect your mood, energy level, focus and overall functioning. If you have sleep troubles, make sure that you have a quiet, relaxing bedtime routine. For example, listen to soothing music, make sure the area you sleep in is cool, dark and quiet, put phones and tablets away, and stick to a regular schedule. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a good release for otherwise pent-up feelings. Don't think about what to write — let it happen. Write anything that comes to mind. No one else needs to read it. So don't aim for perfect grammar or spelling. Let your thoughts flow on paper, or on the computer screen. Once you're done, you can toss out what you wrote or save it to think about later. Listening to or playing music is a good stress reliever. It can provide a mental distraction, lessen muscle tension and lower stress hormones. Turn up the volume and let your mind be absorbed by the music. If music isn't one of your interests, turn your attention to another hobby you enjoy. For example, try gardening, sewing, reading or sketching. Or try anything that makes you focus on what you're doing rather than what you think you should be doing. If new stressors are making it hard for you to cope or if self-care measures aren't relieving your stress, you may want to think about therapy or counseling. Therapy also may be a good idea if you feel overwhelmed or trapped. You also may think about therapy if you worry a great deal, or if you have trouble carrying out daily routines or meeting duties at work, home or school. Professional counselors or therapists can help you find the sources of your stress and learn new coping tools. There is a problem with\n",

      "Stress can feel like a baseline condition for many of us – especially during a pandemic. But there are ways to help alleviate the very worst of it, whether through support, sleep or radical self-care At a time when all life’s challenges have been amplified by the pandemic – and awareness of burnout, at home and at work, has never been higher – stress might seem to be our baseline condition. For most of us, these periods of pressure pass relatively quickly. Even serious stress can be temporary and, given the chance to recover, we usually will. “But emotional resilience won’t solve everything,” says Rachel Boyd, from the mental health charity Mind. “Some of the causes of stress are very challenging to cope with, even when we feel OK.” Many of our everyday challenges have been amplified by the pandemic and its consequences for the economy and society. Those living with financial hardship, health conditions, or caregiving responsibilities, in particular, may feel there is no end in sight. But even if stress seems essential to your circumstances and you don’t have the option or the resources to change them, there are ways you can support yourself. Short-term bursts of stress can be weathered without a negative impact and can even be productive, says Victoria Zamperoni, senior research officer for the Mental Health Foundation. “But if stress is really intense, frequent or chronic, that’s when you see it having knock-on effects … and the threshold will be different for everybody.” Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child distinguishes between positive, tolerable and toxic stress (the terms refer to the effects on the body, not the stressful event or experience itself – though questions of context, intensity and duration are relevant). Toxic stress response can result from strong, frequent or prolonged adversity without adequate support – and the health effects can accumulate and last for a lifetime. When your situation is so overwhelming, protecting your wellbeing can seem irrelevant or even impossible. But it’s important to take whatever steps you can. Ongoing stress can cause or exacerbate many serious health problems including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, heart disease and heart attacks, and stroke. It impairs your memory, thinking and judgment in the present, and has been linked to developing depression, anxiety and perhaps even Alzheimer’s disease. “Stress is a really important physical influence and it deserves to be taken seriously,” says Zamperoni. “If someone is struggling, they should reach out for help.” “Stress is often a legitimate response to difficult circumstances, that no amount of resilience or self-care can overcome,” Boyd says. Much prolonged stress is a product of poverty, financial struggle and health conditions and exacerbated by cuts to benefits and support services. So any discussion of ways to cope must acknowledge that the solution lies in structural societal change, such as welfare reform, more protective labour laws and more support and resources for caregivers. Middle-aged women, in particular, shoulder the burden, often working full-time while also caring for young children and elderly parents. “It’s unfair to put all of the responsibility for staying healthy on the individual,” says Zamperoni. “At the same time, that social change is often slow – so people do need resources they can draw on in the meantime.” Everyone’s experience of stress is different, says Zamperoni. “Stressors can vary by your environment, your past and present, and the social or economic situation you find yourself in.” Even genetics inform our stress response, meaning other people’s strategies won’t necessarily help you; the key is to come up with your own. Public Health England’s Every Mind Matters online tool helps people come up with a personalised “mind plan”. “You could say, ‘I’ve got to learn to cope’, but there are specific things that will help you,” says Paul Gilbert, a clinical psychologist and the founder of the Compassionate Mind Foundation. “What’s going to help you with your elderly relatives is not going to be what’s helpful on a Covid ward. Different stressors require different solutions.” Try to approach your stress with curiosity: what triggers it and what makes you feel better? Boyd suggests taking time to reflect on your specific experiences, either alone or with a friend. “You might be surprised to find out just how much you’re coping with at once.” We all know the importance of movement, nutrition and sleep, but it’s not always easy to do something about it, especially when resources are stretched. In desperate circumstances, these might seem like simplistic solutions. But they can either exacerbate your experience of your circumstances or help you to cope. “A good night’s sleep makes a world of difference, which sounds like a pat thing to say – but it really does,” says Zamperoni. As stress is partly physiological, says Gilbert, paying attention to physical health is relevant to regulating our response. Even breathing matters: “Get your body into a position where it’s much more grounded.” If just the thought of taking this on is overwhelming, Boyd suggests only doing what feels comfortable, and taking small steps at a time: “Pick one or two things that feel achievable at first, before moving on to try other ideas. Something as simple as looking after an indoor pot plant or counting the birds you see from your window can help.” Establishing a daily routine adds to a sense of control. If making time for sleep or exercise feels self-indulgent when others are depending on you, reframe it as what you need to do to be an effective provider or caregiver for them. Not only does asking for help lighten your load, it will make your situation feel more tolerable. Individuals’ biological response to stress is moderated by genetics, over which we have no control – but also the availability of supportive relationships, which we do. The feeling that other people care about us activates the brain’s “soothing system” for managing stress, says Gilbert. Even if it’s not possible for us to remove ourselves from the stressor, we can still access a sense of “social safety” by turning to people for help, “rather than just trying to deal with the threat yourself,” says Gilbert. A 2018 systematic review of coping strategies in caregivers found that problem-focused responses – steps to change the relationship between the person and their environment, such as those that reduce time and labour – were associated with less psychological distress and more positive outcomes. Even talking about your stress with a trusted friend will alleviate it. “It’s why, if you’ve got something a bit scary to do, such as going to hospital, having somebody come with you makes you more able to cope,” says Gilbert. Carers UK suggests joining a local support group to connect with people who are dealing with similar challenges. Its online forum also allows anonymous exchanges for those who feel uncomfortable about sharing publicly. You might not be able to escape or change your situation, but you can manage the feeling of being trapped by it. “Internal entrapment” is the tunnel vision that comes from repetitive negative and self-critical thinking, warping perception and worsening our experience of stress. “What sometimes appears to be the stressor isn’t,” says Gilbert. We may even be undermining ourselves with self-talk: “What are you trapped with in your own mind? Do you live in your mind as a compassionate, supportive, empathic, validating self? Or when you experience threat, do you start to criticise yourself and put yourself down?” Whatever your situation, treating yourself with compassion will support you. Gilbert suggests taking whatever breaks possible from your stressors, doing breathing exercises and practising acceptance. “If you tell yourself you can’t cope, it just adds to your stress, rather than saying: ‘OK, this is a difficult situation, it’s not my fault, I’m going to find a way through.’” Understanding the bodily processes at play can also help to put stress into context, Gilbert says. “It’s not something wrong with your decision making, or that you’re just not up to it.” Understandable feelings of frustration, such as about making a mistake or not getting a job, can often escalate to a sense of: “I’m useless”, “Nobody’s ever going to want to hire me”. “Deal with the emotion without then having the second hit of self-criticism,” says Gilbert. The three to become familiar with are anger, anxiety and grief. Some stress may result from permanent life changes, says Gilbert: “If you learn to deal with the ‘big three’, it helps you to come to terms with them.” Likewise, emotional avoidance is an established risk factor for poor mental health. A recent UK-wide study of health and social care workers, exploring the toll of working through the pandemic, found that those who had positive coping strategies had higher levels of mental wellbeing, a better quality of working life and lower rates of burnout. There was an especially strong association for “active coping”: applying your available internal resources to controlling a stressor. Those who reached for negative coping strategies had poorer outcomes, says Paula McFadden, the study’s principal investigator and a senior lecturer in social work at Ulster University. “Things like venting can be therapeutic for people but if it’s ongoing, it also contributes to wellbeing decline.” The study also revealed an association between burnout and self-blame: “That’s an unusual one in a pandemic, with it being out of our control.” Practising self-compassion is not necessarily comfortable or easy at the best of times, says Gilbert. “People often say, ‘It’s about being kind to yourself.’ Well, sure, but the key is how you find the courage and the wisdom to deal with your situation … rather than doing the things that will temporarily make you feel better.” Courage might be needed to leave a relationship, or care for an elderly parent, while it takes wisdom to recognise what can be let go, or what to do next. Both may take time to develop, says Gilbert. But sometimes the next step is about asking yourself: “What would be the most helpful thing?” It might be going to bed early enough to get a good night’s sleep – or accepting that you haven’t had enough sleep and are not fully functioning as a result. Shift workers often have to learn how to cope with being tired, says Gilbert. The key is to be clear about the best way to manage your body and mind to get you through, “and not doing things that make it more difficult.” “Sometimes accepting that there are some things happening to you that you probably can’t do anything about right now, will help you focus your time and energy more productively,” says Boyd. “If you feel prevented by your circumstances … it can help to focus on the areas where you do have some choice and power.” If your stressors are not work-related – and even if they are – your employer may be able to do more to help. The Ulster University study of health and social care workers emphasised the important role of employers in supporting staff through the pressures of the pandemic, and helping them to recover. “People had so many additional pressures in their personal life, they found it sometimes impossible to juggle home schooling kids, caring for elderly relatives and trying to hold down their jobs,” says McFadden. “If employers allowed them to work flexibly, that helped them to cope with their stress at work.” If pressures in your family life could be alleviated by changes to your work patterns, it is worth raising that with your manager – as is the provision of any technology or equipment that would make it easier to work from home. Employers, meanwhile, need to take the initiative by making systemic changes to support staff to take breaks and holidays, to create pathways to expert psychological help, and to make available opportunities for extra recovery time, if necessary. The study showed that even relatively straightforward things, such as clear lines of communication and face-to-face time with managers and colleagues, made a difference to people’s work-related wellbeing and ability to manage stress. “Even if only virtually, connection really matters,” says McFadden. Indeed, the first step to managing the impact of working with long-term stress is to focus attention on what we can do as individuals to support ourselves, and what will work against us. “This is about employers and employees listening, so there is a shared understanding of what the workforce needs to do to help them.” In the case of the health and social care sectors, more funding is what is needed, the study concluded. But as the pressures from the pandemic continue, it is especially vital that we recognise that we are not operating in a vacuum and do what we can to support the workforce and each other. “It’s a really important message to employers, and to employees,” says McFadden. “Create the circumstances where people can adopt these ways of coping.” You can call Mind’s confidential information and support service on 0300 123 3393 (9am-6pm, Monday to Friday).

      "  Taking care of your long-term mental and physical health is an important part of stress management. However, there isn’t always time to take a nap, hike a fourteener, or read a novel. Thus, here are 25 ways to reduce stress in five minutes or less. From eating chocolate to meditating, there is a quick stress-relieving tactic for everyone.  1. Breathe Slow, deep breaths can help lower blood pressure and heart rate. Try pranayama breathing, a yogic method that involves breathing through one nostril at a time to relieve anxiety. The technique is supposed to work the same way as acupuncture, balancing the mind and body. 2. Listen to Music No matter what the song, sometimes belting out the lyrics to a favorite tune makes everything seem all right. If you’re in a public place, just listening to music can be a quick fix for a bad mood. Classical music can be especially relaxing right before bedtime. 3. Take a Quick Walk When you’re feeling overwhelmed or having trouble concentrating, go for a quick stroll around the block. You’ll get the benefits of alone time, physical activity, and a few minutes to gather your thoughts. 4. Find the Sun If it’s a sunny day, head outside for an easy way to lift your spirits. Bright light can be an effective treatment for people who suffer from depression, and can even cheer up otherwise healthy people. 5. Give Yourself a Hand Massage When there’s no professional masseuse in sight, try DIYing a hand massage for instant relaxation that calms a pounding heart. Hands in general can carry a lot of tension. Apply some lotion and start kneading the base of the muscle under the thumb to relieve stress in the shoulders, neck, and scalp. 6. Count Backward When worries are running rampant, try slowly counting to 10 and then back again to calm down. It’s harder to freak out about an upcoming exam or job interview when you’re busy remembering what number comes before seven. 7. Stretch Standing up for a quick stretch can relieve muscle tension and help you relax during a stressful workday. Try a shoulder roll-out or a chest-opening stretch right from the desk chair. 8. Rub Your Feet Over a Golf Ball You can get an impromptu, relaxing foot massage by rubbing your feet back and forth over a golf ball. 9. Close Your Eyes Take a quick break from a busy office or a chaotic household by just lowering your eyelids. It’s an easy way to regain calm and focus. 10. Squeeze a Stress Ball On days when you want to strangle a coworker, your roommate, or the driver in the next lane, squeeze a stress ball instead. It’s an easy, portable, and non-violent way to relieve tension. 11. Try Progressive Relaxation Anxious? Just squeeze, release, and repeat. Progressive relaxation involves tensing the muscles in one body part at a time to achieve a state of calm. The method (also used by actors) is a great way to help fall asleep. 12. Be Alone Five minutes of alone time can help you collect your thoughts and clear your head. 13. Get Organized Clutter could be contributing to your stress. Take a few minutes to reorganize your desk (or table, or wherever you are), leaving just what you need on top. 14. Do Some Yoga Put your feet up—against the wall, of course. The Vipariti Kirani yoga pose involves lying on the floor and resting the legs up against a wall. Not only does it give the body a good stretch, but it helps create peace of mind, too. 15. Eat Some Chocolate Just a square (about 1.4 ounces) of the sweet stuff can calm your nerves. Dark chocolate regulates levels of the stress hormone cortisol and stabilizes metabolism. 16. Meditate Five minutes of peace is all it takes to reap the benefits of meditation. There’s evidence that just two quick bouts of silent meditation per day can relieve stress and depression. Find a comfortable spot in a quiet place, focus on your breath, and feel those anxieties start to disappear. 17. Cuddle With a Pet After a rough day, snuggle up with a pet. Pets can boost self-esteem and even ease the sting of social rejection. 18. Chew Gum A stick of gum is a surprisingly quick and easy way to beat stress. No matter the flavor, just a few minutes of chewing can actually reduce anxiety and lower cortisol levels. 19. Sip Green Tea Green tea is a source of L-Theanine, a chemical that helps relieve anger. Boil the water, pour it out, and take a soothing sip. 20. Laugh Laughter is one of the sillier ways to beat stress, but there’s science behind it. A fit of hysterics can increase blood flow and boost immunity. Check out a hilarious YouTube video (maybe a piano-playing pug?) for a quick pick-me-up. 21. Drip Cold Water On Your Wrists When stress hits, head for the bathroom and drop some cold water on your wrists and behind your earlobes. There are major arteries right underneath the skin, so cooling these areas can help calm the whole body. 22. Create a Zen Zone Make (or find) a space that’s completely free of stress where you can go to relax. Set up a comfortable chair or light some incense and disappear there for a few minutes until the tension dissipates. 23. Write It Down Putting our emotions on paper can make them seem less intimidating. Try journaling before a big exam to calm your nerves. 24. Slurp Some Honey Drown that stress in sweetness with a spoonful of honey. Besides being a natural skin moisturizer and antibiotic, honey also provides compounds that reduce inflammation in the brain, meaning it fights depression and anxiety. 25. Talk to a Friend When something’s really bothering you, it can help to share your feelings with a buddy. In fact, more talkative folks tend to be happier in general. So vent to a coworker, friend, or family member. News Events Donate University of Colorado Law School\n",

Is stress making you angry and grouchy? Stress relievers can help bring back calm and peace to your busy life. You don't have to put a lot of time or thought into stress relievers. If your stress is getting out of control and you need quick relief, try one of these tips. Almost any form of physical activity can act as a stress reliever. Even if you're not an athlete or you're out of shape, exercise can still be a good stress reliever. Physical activity can pump up your feel-good endorphins and other natural neural chemicals that boost your sense of well-being. Exercise also can refocus your mind on your body's movements. This refocus can improve your mood and help the day's irritations fade away. So go on a walk, take a jog, work in your garden, clean your house, bike, swim, weight train, vacuum or do anything else that gets you active. Eating a healthy diet is an important part of taking care of yourself. Aim to eat many fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Some people may deal with stress with unhealthy habits. These may include drinking too much caffeine or alcohol, smoking, eating too much, or using illegal substances. These habits can harm your health and increase your stress levels. During meditation, you focus your attention and quiet the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can help both your emotional well-being and your overall health. Meditation can empower us to enhance our well-being. You can practice guided meditation, guided imagery, mindfulness, visualization and other forms of meditation anywhere at any time. For example, you could meditate when you're out for a walk, riding the bus to work or waiting at your health care provider's office. Try an app to show you how to do these exercises. And you can try deep breathing anywhere. A good sense of humor can't cure all ailments. But it can help you feel better, even if you have to force a fake laugh through your grumpiness. When you laugh, it lightens your mental load. It also causes positive physical changes in the body. Laughter fires up and then cools down your stress response. So read some jokes, tell some jokes, watch a comedy or hang out with your funny friends. Or give laughter yoga a try. When you're stressed and irritable, you may want to isolate yourself. Instead, reach out to family and friends and make social connections. Even one good friend who listens can make a difference. Social contact is a good stress reliever because it can offer distraction, give support, and help you put up with life's up and downs. So take a coffee break with a friend, email a relative or visit your place of worship. Got more time? Try volunteering for a charity and help yourself while helping others. You might want to do it all, but you can't, at least not without paying a price. Learning to say no or being willing to delegate can help you manage your to-do list and your stress. Healthy boundaries are important in a wellness journey. Everyone has physical and emotional limits. Saying yes may seem like an easy way to keep the peace, prevent conflicts and get the job done right. But instead, it may cause you inner conflict because your needs and those of your family come second. Putting yourself second can lead to stress, anger, resentment and even the wish to take revenge. And that's not a very calm and peaceful reaction. Remember, you're a priority. With its series of postures and breathing exercises, yoga is a popular stress reliever. Yoga brings together physical and mental disciplines that may help you reach peace of body and mind. Yoga can help you relax and ease stress and anxiety. Try yoga on your own or find a class — you can find classes in many areas. Hatha yoga, especially, is a good stress reliever because of its slower pace and easier movements. Stress can cause you to have trouble falling asleep. When you have too much to do — and too much to think about — your sleep can suffer. But sleep is the time when your brain and body recharge. Most adults need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. And how well and how long you sleep can affect your mood, energy level, focus and overall functioning. If you have sleep troubles, make sure that you have a quiet, relaxing bedtime routine. For example, listen to soothing music, make sure the area you sleep in is cool, dark and quiet, put phones and tablets away, and stick to a regular schedule. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a good release for otherwise pent-up feelings. Don't think about what to write — let it happen. Write anything that comes to mind. No one else needs to read it. So don't aim for perfect grammar or spelling. Let your thoughts flow on paper, or on the computer screen. Once you're done, you can toss out what you wrote or save it to think about later. Listening to or playing music is a good stress reliever. It can provide a mental distraction, lessen muscle tension and lower stress hormones. Turn up the volume and let your mind be absorbed by the music. If music isn't one of your interests, turn your attention to another hobby you enjoy. For example, try gardening, sewing, reading or sketching. Or try anything that makes you focus on what you're doing rather than what you think you should be doing. If new stressors are making it hard for you to cope or if self-care measures aren't relieving your stress, you may want to think about therapy or counseling. Therapy also may be a good idea if you feel overwhelmed or trapped. You also may think about therapy if you worry a great deal, or if you have trouble carrying out daily routines or meeting duties at work, home or school. Professional counselors or therapists can help you find the sources of your stress and learn new coping tools. There is a problem with\n",

      "Home Healthy living Mental wellbeing Stress What to do if you are struggling with stress Stress is the feeling of being under too much mental or emotional pressure. Pressure turns into stress when you feel unable to cope. People have different ways of reacting to stress, so a situation that feels stressful to one person may be motivating to someone else. Many of life’s demands can cause stress, particularly work, relationships and money problems. When you feel stressed, it can get in the way of sorting out these demands, or can even affect everything you do. Stress can affect how you feel, think, behave and how your body works. In fact, common signs of stress include:  You may also: You may also experience:  Stress causes a surge of hormones in your body. These stress hormones are released to enable you to deal with pressures or threats – the so-called “fight or flight” response. Once the pressure or threat has passed, your stress hormone levels will usually return to normal. However, if you’re constantly under stress, these hormones will remain in your body, leading to the symptoms of stress. Stress is not an illness itself, but it can cause serious illness if it isn’t addressed. It’s important to recognise the symptoms of stress early. Recognising the signs and symptoms of stress will help you figure out ways of coping and save you from adopting unhealthy coping methods, such as drinking or smoking. There is little you can do to prevent stress, but there are many things you can do to manage stress more effectively, such as learning how to relax, taking regular exercise and adopting good time-management techniques. Studies have found that mindfulness courses, where participants are taught simple meditations across a series of weeks, can also help to reduce stress and improve mood. If you’ve tried self-help techniques and they aren’t working, you should go to see your GP. They may suggest other coping techniques for you to try or recommend some form of counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy. If your stress is causing serious health problems, such as high blood pressure, you may need to take medication or further tests. Mental health issues, including stress, anxiety and depression, are the reason for 1 in 5 visits to a GP. If you’re not sure what’s causing your stress, keep a diary and make a note of stressful episodes for 2 to 4 weeks. Then review it to spot the triggers. Things you might want to write down include: You can use the diary to: Doctors sometimes recommend keeping a stress diary to help them diagnose stress. There’s no quick-fix cure for stress, and no single method will work for everyone. However, there are simple things you can do to change the common life problems that can cause stress or make stress a problem. These include relaxation techniques, exercise and talking the issues through. Many people find exercises that focus on breathing and muscle relaxation to be helpful in relieving stress. The playlist below will help you to understand how stress works and start feeling better. These exercises can be done anywhere and are designed to help you feel more relaxed in general, as well as helping you feel calmer if you are becoming stressed. This playlist is free to download, and you can also stream it using the Soundcloud website or app. You can download and listen to individual tracks if there are particular exercises that work best for you. If you’re listening to it for the first time, it’s best to start from the beginning. To access a BSL version of this playlist, click here. Find out more by checking out these 10 stress busters. Because talking through the issues is one of the key ways to tackle stress, you may find it useful to attend a stress management group or class. These are sometimes run in doctors’ surgeries or community centres. The classes help people identify the cause of their stress and develop effective coping techniques. It’s always better to talk about your anxieties or stresses sooner rather than later. You may wish to phone a helpline such as Breathing Space (0800 83 85 87, open 6pm to 2am, Monday to Thursday and 24 hours at the weekend, from 6pm Friday to 6am Monday) where their advisors can listen and help you figure out ways of coping. Ask your GP for more information if you’re interested in attending a stress support group. You can also use the search directory to find emotional support services in your area.

      "This content discusses depression, anxiety and alcohol or drug use, which some people may find triggering. This guide provides you with tips on how to manage and reduce stress Stress is a feeling of being under abnormal pressure, whether from an increased workload, an argument with a family member, or financial worries. You can read the guide below, download it as a PDF or buy printed copies in our online shop. Stress affects us in lots of ways, both physically and emotionally, and in varying intensities. Research has shown that stress can sometimes be positive. It makes us more alert and helps us perform better in certain situations. However, stress has only been found to be beneficial if it is short-lived. Excessive or prolonged stress can lead to illnesses such as heart disease and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. During situations that make you feel threatened or upset, your body creates a stress response. This can cause a variety of physical symptoms, change the way you behave, and lead you to experience more intense emotions. People react differently to stress. Some common symptoms of stress include sleeping problems, sweating, or a change in appetite. Symptoms like these are triggered by a rush of stress hormones in your body which, when released, allow you to deal with pressures or threats. This is known as the ‘fight or flight’ response. Hormones called adrenaline and noradrenaline raise your blood pressure, increase your heart rate and increase the amount you sweat. This prepares your body for an emergency response. These hormones can also reduce blood flow to your skin and reduce your stomach activity. Cortisol, another stress hormone, releases fat and sugar into your system to boost your energy. As a result, you may experience headaches, muscle tension, pain, nausea, indigestion and dizziness. You may also breathe more quickly, have palpitations or suffer from various aches and pains. In the long term, you may be putting yourself at risk of heart attacks and strokes. Humans have inherited these things from our ancient ancestors, who needed to be able to either run away from danger or stay and fight. Once the pressure or threat has passed, your stress hormone levels usually return to normal. However, if you’re constantly under stress, these hormones remain in your body, leading to the symptoms of stress. If you’re stuck in a busy office or on an overcrowded train, you can’t run away, so you can’t use up the chemicals your own body makes to protect you. Over time, the build-up of these chemicals and the changes they produce can be damaging to your health. When you are stressed you may have lots of different feelings, including anxiety, irritability or low self-esteem, which can lead you to become withdrawn, indecisive or tearful. You may have periods of constant worry, racing thoughts, or repeatedly going over the same things in your head. Some people experience changes in their behaviour. They may lose their temper more easily, act irrationally or become more verbally or physically aggressive. These feelings can feed on each other and produce physical symptoms, which can make you feel even worse. For example, extreme anxiety can make you feel so unwell that you then worry you have a serious physical condition. Everyone experiences stress. However, when it affects your life, health and well-being, it’s important to tackle it as soon as possible. While stress affects everyone differently, there are common signs and symptoms for you to look out for: If you experience these symptoms for a prolonged period of time, and feel they are affecting your everyday life or making you feel unwell, speak to your GP. Ask them for information about the support services and treatments available to you. All sorts of situations can cause stress. The most common involve work, money matters and relationships with partners, children or other family members. Stress can be caused either by major upheavals and life events such as divorce, unemployment, moving house and bereavement, or by a series of minor irritations such as feeling undervalued at work or arguing with a family member. Sometimes, there are no obvious causes. As a result, you may experience headaches, muscle tension, pain, nausea, indigestion and dizziness. You may also breathe more quickly, have palpitations or suffer from various aches and pains. In the long term, you may be putting yourself at risk of heart attacks and strokes. Relationships are a great support in times when we feel stressed. However, from time to time the people close to you, be it a partner, parent, child, friend or colleague, can increase your stress levels. Events such as ongoing minor arguments and disagreements, to larger family crises, such as an affair, illness or bereavement are likely to affect the way you think, feel and behave. This may consequently have an impact on your stress levels. Find out more about investing in healthy relationships. The pressure of an increasingly demanding work culture in the UK is one of the biggest contributors to stress among the general population. While current, average full-time working hours are 37 hours a week, a recent and dramatic rise in Britain’s working hours suggests this is already on the increase. 20.1% of the UK working population work 45 hours or more each week. The human costs of unmanaged work-related stress is extensive. Feeling unhappy about the amount of time you spend at work and neglecting other aspects of life because of work may increase your vulnerability to stress. Increased levels of stress can, if not addressed early enough, lead to burnout or more severe mental health problems. Mental health problems such as anxiety and depression are thought to be the leading cause of work absences, accounting for up to 40% of sick leave. In 2008, mental health accounted for 442,000 cases of work-related illness with a related estimated cost of £13.5 million. As a result, mental ill-health now accounts for a significant proportion of long-term sickness and early retirement, cited as the leading cause of illness for 20% of NHS employees. Money and debt concerns place huge pressure on us, so it comes as no surprise that they have a marked effect on our stress levels. The effects of the cost-of-living crisis in 2022 has affected everyone in some capacity. A survey of 3000 adults commissioned by the Mental Health Foundation in November 2022 found that one in ten UK adults was feeling hopeless about their financial circumstances. More than one-third were feeling anxious and almost three in ten were feeling stressed. The combination of chronic stress and debt can result in depression and anxiety and has been highlighted as a factor linked to suicidal thoughts and attempts. It’s important if you are worried about your finances and debts that you do not try to deal with them alone. There’s a lot of help and support available to you through organisations such as StepChange and Citizens Advice. You could also talk to your GP or a trusted health professional if you are worried about how debt is affecting your mental and physical health. Some people smoke, drink alcohol and use recreational drugs to reduce stress. But, this often makes problems worse. Research shows that smoking may increase feelings of anxiety. Nicotine creates an immediate, temporary, sense of relaxation, which can then lead to withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Similarly, people may use alcohol as a means to manage and cope with difficult feelings, and to temporarily reduce feelings of anxiety. But, alcohol can make existing mental health problems worse. It can make you feel more anxious and depressed in the long run. It’s important to know the recommended limits and drink responsibly. Prescription drugs, such as tranquillisers and sleeping tablets, which may have been prescribed for very good reasons, can also cause mental and physical health problems if used for long periods of time. Street drugs, such as cannabis or ecstasy, are usually taken for recreational purposes. For some people, problems start as their bodies get used to repeated use of the drug. This leads to the need for increased doses to maintain the same effect Stress is a natural reaction to difficult situations in life, such as work, family, relationships and money problems. We mentioned earlier on that a moderate amount of stress can help us perform better in challenging situations, but too much or prolonged stress can lead to physical problems. This can include lower immunity levels, digestive and intestinal difficulties such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or mental health problems such as depression. So, it’s important that we manage our stress and keep it at a healthy level to prevent long-term damage to our bodies and minds. When you are feeling stressed, try to take these steps: You can also help protect yourself from stress in a number of ways: It’s okay to ask for professional help if you feel that you are struggling to manage on your own. It’s also important to get help as soon as possible so you can begin to get better. The first person to approach is your GP. They should be able to give you advice about treatment, and may refer you to another local professional. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Mindfulness-based approaches are known to help reduce stress. There are also a number of voluntary organisations which can help you to tackle the causes of stress and advise you about ways to get better. Some teams provide 24-hour services so that you can contact them in a crisis. You should be able to contact your local CMHT through your local social services or social work team.

Learn how tension affects your health and how to reduce everyday stress. When your car dies or a deadline looms, how do you respond? Long-term, low-grade or acute stress takes a serious toll on your body and mind, so don’t ignore feelings of constant tension. Stress is a natural part of life. However, too much stress can harm our health, especially if it continues every day. This is chronic stress and can put you at risk for heart problems like heart disease and depression. Understand what’s happening inside your body and learn simple coping skills to combat the negative impacts of everyday stressors. There are two types of stress: Sudden or ongoing stress activates your nervous system and floods your bloodstream with adrenaline and cortisol, two hormones that raise blood pressure, increase heart rate and spike blood sugar. These changes pitch your body into a fight or flight response. That enabled our ancestors to outrun saber-toothed tigers, and it’s helpful today for situations like dodging a car accident. But most modern chronic stressors, such as finances or a challenging relationship, keep your body in that heightened state, which hurts your health. If constantly under stress, most of us will eventually start to function less well.  Multiple studies link chronic stress to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, weight gain, memory loss and even premature death, so it's important to recognize the warning signals. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage stress if you’re experiencing any of these symptoms: It’s key to recognize stressful situations as they occur because it allows you to focus on managing how you react. We all need to know when to close our eyes and take a deep breath when we feel tension rising. Use these tips to prevent or reduce chronic stress. 1. Rebalance Work and Home All work and no play? If you’re spending too much time at the office, intentionally put more dates in your calendar to enjoy time for fun, either alone or with others. 2. Get Regular Exercise Moving your body on a regular basis balances the nervous system and increases blood circulation, helping to flush out stress hormones. Even a daily 20-minute walk makes a difference. Any kind of exercise can lower stress and improve your mood ― just pick activities that you enjoy and make it a regular habit. 3. Eat Well and Limit Alcohol and Stimulants Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine may temporarily relieve stress but have negative health impacts and can make stress worse in the long run. Well-nourished bodies cope better, so start with a good breakfast, add more organic fruits and vegetables for a well-balanced diet, avoid processed foods and sugar, try herbal tea and drink more water. 4. Connect with Supportive People Talking face to face with another person releases hormones that reduce stress. Lean on those good listeners in your life. 5. Carve Out Hobby Time Do you enjoy gardening, reading, listening to music or some other creative pursuit? Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and joy; research shows that reduces stress by almost half and lowers your heart rate, too. 6. Practice Meditation, Stress Reduction or Yoga Relaxation techniques activate a state of restfulness that counterbalances your body’s fight-or-flight hormones. Even if this also means a 10-minute break in a long day: listen to music, read, go for a walk in nature, do a hobby, take a bath or spend time with a friend. Also consider taking a mindfulness-based stress reduction course to learn effective, lasting tools or try a daily deep breathing or imagery practice. Deep Breathing Slow, calm and deep breathing can help you relax. Try these steps to focus on your breathing and repeat as needed. Imagery This involves using your mind to excite the senses — sound, vision, smell, taste and feeling. This may help ease your stress. 7. Sleep Enough If you get less than seven to eight hours of sleep, your body won’t tolerate stress as well as it could. If stress keeps you up at night, address the cause and add extra meditation into your day to make up for the lost z’s. Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Make a regular bedtime schedule. Keep your room dark and cool. Try to avoid computers, TV, cell phones and tablets before bed. 8. Bond with Connections You Enjoy Go out for a coffee with a friend, chat with a neighbor, call a family member, visit with a clergy member, or even hang out with your pet. Clinical studies show that spending even a short time with a companion animal can cut anxiety levels almost in half. 9. Take a Vacation Getting away from it all can reset your stress tolerance by increasing your mental and emotional outlook, which makes you a happier, more productive person upon return. Leave your cellphone and laptop at home! 10. See a Counselor, Coach or Therapist If negative thoughts overwhelm your ability to make positive changes, it’s time to seek professional help.

A 6-week study of 185 university students found that participating in aerobic exercise 2 days per week significantly reduced overall perceived stress and perceived stress due to uncertainty. Plus, the exercise routine significantly improved self-reported depression. Regular exercise has been shown to improve symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression (15, 16). If you’re currently inactive, start with gentle activities such as walking or biking. Choosing an activity that you enjoy may help increase your chances of sticking to it in the long term.  Your diet affects every aspect of your health, including your mental health. A 2022 review of research suggests that people who follow a diet high in ultra-processed foods and added sugar are more likely to experience higher perceived stress levels. Being chronically stressed may lead you to overeat and reach for highly palatable foods, which may harm your overall health and mood. Not eating enough nutrient-dense whole foods may increase your risk of deficiencies in nutrients essential for regulating stress and mood, such as magnesium and B vitamins. Minimizing your intake of highly processed foods and beverages and eating more whole foods can help ensure your body is properly nourished. In turn, this may improve your resilience to stress. Whole food options can include: While smartphones, computers, and tablets are often necessary, using them too often may increase stress levels. A 2021 review of literature points out that several studies have linked excessive smartphone use with increased stress levels and mental health disorders. Spending too much time in front of screens is associated with lower psychological well-being and increased stress levels in adults and kids. Furthermore, screen time may negatively affect sleep, which may also lead to increased stress levels. Setting aside time to practice self-care may help reduce your stress levels. Practical examples include: People who engage in self-care typically have lower levels of stress and improved quality of life, while a lack of self-care is associated with a higher risk of stress and burnout. Taking time for yourself is essential to live a healthy life. This is especially important for people who tend to be highly stressed, including nurses, doctors, teachers, and caretakers. Self-care doesn’t have to be elaborate or complicated. It simply means tending to your well-being and happiness.  Exposure to certain scents via candles or essential oils may be especially calming. Here are a few relaxing scents: Using scents to boost your mood is called aromatherapy. Aromatherapy can decrease anxiety and improve sleep. Journaling may help reduce stress and anxiety and provide a positive outlet for your thoughts and emotions.  A 2018 study noted that expressive writing or therapeutic writing can benefit people managing chronic health conditions, including but not limited to mental health conditions like depression. They noted that regular journaling may be linked to a higher quality of life, more proactive self-care behaviors, and other healthful behaviors, such as taking prescribed medications.  You can also try a guided journal if you’d prefer more targeted, expressive writing. Caffeine is a chemical in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks that stimulates your central nervous system.  Consuming too much may worsen anxiety, according to a 2021 review of literature on the subject. Overconsumption may also harm your sleep. In turn, this may increase stress and anxiety symptoms. People have different thresholds for how much caffeine they can tolerate. If caffeine makes you jittery or anxious, consider cutting back by replacing coffee or energy drinks with decaffeinated coffee, herbal tea, or water. Although coffee has health benefits in moderation, it’s recommended to keep caffeine intake under 400 mg daily, which equals 4–5 cups (0.9–1.2 L) of coffee. Still, people sensitive to caffeine may experience increased anxiety and stress after consuming less caffeine than this, so it’s important to consider your tolerance.  Social support from friends and family may help you get through stressful times and cope with stress. One 2019 study in 163 ​​Latinx college-age young adults associated lower levels of support from friends, family, and romantic partners with loneliness, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Having a social support system is important for your overall mental health. If you’re feeling alone and don’t have friends or family to depend on, social support groups may help. Consider joining a club or sports team or volunteering for a cause that’s important to you. Not all stressors are within your control, but some are. Putting too much on your plate may increase your stress load and limit the amount of time you can spend on self-care. One way to help reduce stress and protect your mental health may be to say “no” more often. This is especially true if you take on more than you can handle because juggling many responsibilities may leave you feeling overwhelmed. Being selective about what you take on — and saying “no” to things that will unnecessarily add to your load — can reduce your stress levels. Creating boundaries — especially with people who add to your stress levels — is a healthy way to protect your well-being. This can be as simple as asking a friend or family member not to stop by unannounced or canceling standing plans with a friend if you need more space. Another way to take control of your stress is to stay on top of your priorities and avoid procrastinating when you aren’t feeling stressed. Procrastination may harm your productivity and leave you scrambling to catch up. This can cause stress, which negatively affects your health and sleep quality. It’s also true that you may be more likely to procrastinate in times of stress as a coping mechanism. A study in 140 medical students in China linked procrastination to increased stress levels. The study also associated procrastination and delayed stress reactions with more negative parenting styles, including punishment and rejection. If you find yourself procrastinating regularly, it may be helpful to make a to-do list organized by priority. Give yourself realistic deadlines and work your way down the list. Sometimes, adding an item to the list may help you feel better about it, even if it doesn’t get done immediately. Work on the things that need to get done today, and give yourself chunks of uninterrupted time. Switching between tasks or multitasking can be stressful in itself. Yoga has become a popular method of stress relief and exercise among all age groups. While yoga styles differ, most share a common goal — to join your body and mind by increasing body and breath awareness. Research shows that yoga helps reduce stress and anxiety. Plus, it can promote psychological well-being. These benefits seem related to yoga’s effect on your nervous system and stress response.  Yoga may help lower cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate while increasing levels of gamma aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter that’s low in people with mood disorders. Mindfulness describes practices that anchor you to the present moment. Stress reduction techniques that utilize mindfulness include meditation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Meditating consistently, even for short periods, may help boost your mood and decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety.  Countless books, apps, and websites can teach you the basics if you want to try meditation. There may also be therapists in your area who specialize in MBCT.  Human touch may have a calming effect and help you better cope with stress. For example, studies show positive physical contact may help relieve stress and loneliness. These types of contact may help release oxytocin and lower cortisol. In turn, these effects help lower blood pressure and heart rate. Both high blood pressure and increased heart rate are physical symptoms of stress. Spending more time outside may help reduce stress. Studies show that spending time in green spaces such as parks and forests and being immersed in nature are healthy ways to manage stress. A review of 14 studies found that spending as little as 10 minutes in a natural setting may help improve psychological and physiological markers of mental well-being, including perceived stress and happiness, in college-aged people. Hiking and camping are great options, but some people don’t enjoy — or have access to — these activities. Even in an urban area, you can seek out green spaces such as local parks, arboretums, and botanical gardens. Mental stress activates your sympathetic nervous system, sending your body into fight-or-flight mode. During this reaction, stress hormones trigger physical symptoms such as a faster heartbeat, quicker breathing, and constricted blood vessels. Deep breathing exercises may help activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the relaxation response. Deep breathing exercises include: Deep breathing aims to focus your awareness on your breath, making it slower and deeper. When you breathe in deeply through your nose, your lungs fully expand, and your belly rises. This helps slow your heart rate, allowing you to feel at peace. Having a pet may help reduce stress and improve your mood. When you cuddle or touch your pet, your body releases oxytocin — a hormone linked to a positive mood. Plus, research shows that pet owners — especially those with dogs — tend to have greater life satisfaction, better self-esteem, reduced levels of loneliness and anxiety, and more positive moods. Having a pet may also help relieve stress by giving you purpose, keeping you active, and providing companionship. Several vitamins and minerals play an important role in your body’s stress response and mood regulation. As such, a deficiency in one or more nutrients may affect your mental health and ability to cope with stress. Some studies show that certain dietary supplements may help reduce stress and improve mood.  For example, your magnesium levels may deplete when you’re chronically stressed.  Since this mineral plays an important role in your body’s stress response, you may want to ensure you’re getting enough each day. Supplementing with magnesium has been shown to improve stress in chronically stressed people. Other supplements, including Rhodiola, ashwagandha, B vitamins, and L-theanine, may also help reduce stress, though more research is needed to understand their potential benefits better. However, dietary supplements may not be appropriate or safe for everyone. Consult a healthcare professional if you’re interested in using supplements to help relieve stress.  Although stress is unavoidable, being chronically stressed takes a toll on your physical and mental health.  Fortunately, several evidence-based strategies can help you reduce stress and improve your overall psychological well-being.  Exercise, mindfulness, spending time with a pet, minimizing screen time, and getting outside more often are all effective methods.  Read this article in Spanish.

      " If you're stressed, whether by your job or something more personal, the first step to feeling better is to identify the cause. The most unhelpful thing you can do is turn to something unhealthy to help you cope, such as smoking or drinking. Not taking control of the situation and doing nothing can make your problems worse. Some of the keys to good stress management are building emotional strength, being in control of your situation, having a good social network, and adopting a positive outlook.  Try these 10 stress-busting suggestions: Exercise won't make your stress disappear, but it can reduce some of the emotional intensity that you're feeling, clearing your thoughts and letting you deal with your problems more calmly. For more advice, read about exercise for depression. Get started with exercise If you think you cannot do anything about your problem, your stress can get worse. That feeling of loss of control is one of the main causes of stress and lack of wellbeing. The act of taking control is in itself empowering, and it's a crucial part of finding a solution that satisfies you and not someone else. A good support network of colleagues, friends and family can ease your work troubles and help you see things in a different way. The activities we do with friends can help us relax and relieve stress. Talking things through with a friend may also help you find solutions to your problems. Read about 5 steps to mental wellbeing, including the benefits of connecting with other people. Many of us work long hours, meaning we often don't spend enough time doing things we really enjoy. It's important to take some time for socialising, relaxation or exercise. You could try setting aside a couple of nights a week for some quality \"me time\" away from work. Setting yourself goals and challenges, whether at work or outside, such as learning a new language or a new sport, can help build confidence. This may help you deal with stress. It can also make you want to do things and be active. Don't rely on alcohol, smoking and caffeine as your ways of coping. They might provide temporary relief, but in the long term, these crutches won't solve your problems. They'll just create new ones. It's best to tackle the cause of your stress. Evidence shows that people who help others, through activities such as volunteering or community work, often become more resilient. If you don't have time to volunteer, try to do someone a favour every day. It can be something as small as helping someone cross the road or going on a coffee run for colleagues. Find out more about giving for mental wellbeing Working smarter means prioritising your work, concentrating on the tasks that'll make a real difference. Leave the least important tasks to last. Accept that you will not have time for everything. Look for the positives in life, and things for which you're grateful. Try writing down 3 things that went well, or for which you're grateful, at the end of every day. In this audio guide, a doctor helps you to replace negative thoughts with more positive thinking. Changing a difficult situation isn't always possible. Try to concentrate on the things you do have control over. For example, if your company is making redundancies, you could focus on the things that you can control, such as looking for a new job. In this audio guide, a doctor explains what you can do to give yourself the best chance of a good night's sleep. \n",

      "A healthy diet, regular exercise and counseling can all help reduce stress We could all use a little less stress in our lives, am I right? Between everyday work stress to maintaining relationships, navigating social engagements and wrangling the kids stress, there’s more than enough stress to go around. Luckily, there are ways to ease your stress levels if you set your mind to it. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Clinical psychologist Adam Borland, PsyD, explains how stress works and healthy ways we can help manage stress before it gets out of control. Stress is your body’s response to a challenge or demand. Everyone experiences stress, which can be triggered by a range of events, from small daily hassles to major changes like a divorce or job loss. The stress response includes physical components like an elevated heart rate and blood pressure, thoughts and personal beliefs about the stressful event, and emotions, including fear and anger. “Although we often think of it as being negative, stress can also come from positive changes in your life, like getting a promotion at work or having a new baby,” says Dr. Borland. Stress serves an important purpose — it enables us to respond quickly to threats and avoid danger. But lengthy exposure to stress may lead to mental health difficulties like anxiety and depression, or increased physical health problems. “A large body of research suggests that increased stress levels interfere with your ability to deal with physical illness,” says Dr. Borland. “While no one can avoid all stress, you can work to handle it in healthy ways that increase your potential to recover.” Some people try to reduce stress by drinking alcohol or eating too much. These actions may seem to help in the moment, but actually may add to stress in the long run. Caffeine also can compound the effects of stress. While consuming a healthy, balanced diet can help combat stress. In addition to having physical health benefits, exercise has been shown to be a powerful stress reliever. Consider noncompetitive aerobic exercise, strengthening with weights or movement activities like yoga or Tai Chi, and set reasonable goals for yourself. Aerobic exercise has been shown to release endorphins — natural substances that help you feel better and maintain a positive attitude. People who use nicotine often refer to it as a stress reliever. However, nicotine actually places more stress on your body by increasing physical arousal and reducing blood flow and breathing. Plus, it can worsen chronic pain, so if you’re experiencing prolonged tension and body aches, smoking won’t help. Taking the time to relax every day helps manage stress and protect your body from the effects of stress. You can choose from a variety of techniques, such as deep breathing, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation. Many online and smartphone apps provide guidance on these techniques. Although some require purchase costs, many are available free of charge. If you’re like most people, your life may be filled with too many demands and too little time. For the most part, these demands are ones we’ve chosen. But you can free up time by practicing time-management skills like asking for help when it’s appropriate, setting priorities, pacing yourself and reserving time to take care of yourself. The more your actions reflect your beliefs, the better you’ll feel, no matter how busy your life is. Use your values when choosing your activities. “Considering the stressful demands and responsibilities we face on a daily basis, it’s important to engage in activities that are in line with our values and speak to us on a personal level,” encourages Dr. Borland. It’s OK to say “no” to demands on your time and energy that’ll place too much stress on you. You don’t always have to meet the expectations of others. It’s also OK — and healthy — to realize you can’t be 100% successful at everything all at once. Be mindful of the things you can control and work on accepting the things that you can’t control. When you’re feeling overwhelmed, remind yourself of what you do well. There are ways you can build a healthy sense of self-esteem. This behavioral technique helps you learn stress reduction skills by providing information about muscle tension, heart rate and other vital signs as you attempt to relax. It’s used to gain control over certain bodily functions that cause tension and physical pain. Biofeedback can be used to help you learn how your body responds in stressful situations, and how to cope better. If a headache, such as a migraine, begins slowly, many people can use biofeedback to stop the attack before it becomes full-blown. If you’re interested in any of these techniques, ask your healthcare provider for more information or other suggestions they may have. Often, counseling can help you recognize stress factors that may not even be readily obvious. Sleep is often sacrificed when you’re overwhelmed with stress. You may experience insomnia because of discomfort, stress from personal concerns, or side effects from your medications. If you can’t sleep, try these tips: Your body’s natural response to stress can lead to painful skin irritation Too much screen time and unrealistic expectations and perceptions and can lead to an increased risk of anxiety and depression  Although different conditons, they can occur together or cause one another Whether you’re trying to work out more, drink less or manage stress, we can help set you up for success If the thought of the gym sends you spiraling, do some prep work beforehand and bring a friend along for support Stay merry and bright by knowing your triggers and journaling throughout your visit There’s no evidence to prove this supplement can help with weight loss, and it may come with risks Being the center of attention doesn’t mean you have to exile your guest stars Research is inconclusive whether or not these supplements are helpful Your metabolism may torch 1,300 to 2,000 calories daily with no activity The hump at the base of your neck may be caused by osteoporosis or poor posture\n"

      " Do you handle stress as well as you used to? For most folks, it gets harder as the years go by — and that’s a potential problem for health. Stress increases the risks for chronic disease, to which the body is already more vulnerable after a lifetime of wear and tear (and perhaps unhealthy habits, such as a poor diet or not exercising). We need the body’s stress (\"fight or flight\") response to get us through tough times. When you sense a threat or danger, your body rises to the challenge by releasing stress hormones, tightening your muscles, making your blood pressure rise and your heart and lungs work harder, and releasing a surge of fat and sugar to give you energy. When danger subsides, your body goes back to normal operations. If you get stressed out frequently, however, the stress response can become constant and cause ongoing harm, including chronic inflammation — the persistent activation of the immune system, which sharply raises the risks for many diseases such as dementia, heart disease, and stroke. The best way to cope with stress is by getting at least seven hours of sleep per day, eating a predominantly plant-based diet, exercising regularly, meditating, and staying socially connected. \"If you’re practicing all these healthy habits, it helps you become more resilient and better able to adapt to life’s challenging situations,\" says Dr. Shalu Ramchandani, an integrative medicine specialist at the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Something else that helps: quelling the body’s stress response whenever you feel triggered. Try any of these tips for on-the-spot relief. Do a relaxation exercise. The relaxation response — the opposite of the stress response — was defined by Harvard Medical School professor Herbert Benson. It slows your breathing, reduces your heart rate, and lowers your stress hormones. To elicit this state, Dr. Ramchandani recommends a basic breathing exercise, such as taking 10 very slow breaths in and out. Or try an imagery exercise: \"Imagine being in your favorite vacation place, maybe the beach or in nature,\" Dr. Ramchandani suggests. \"Imagine all the sensations you’d experience there, such as the sight and sound of the waves, the smell of the ocean, and the breeze brushing against your skin. Hold this image for a few minutes and notice the relaxing effect.\" Stretch your muscles. Your muscles tense up under stress. Relieve that tension by stretching. \"While sitting or standing, inhale, raise your arms overhead, lace your fingers together, stretch, release your fingers, and exhale as you lower your arms to each side. Repeat three times,\" Dr. Ramchandani says. Take a mindfulness break. Being mindful helps elicit the relaxation response by bringing you to the present moment; it can break a cycle of stressful thoughts. It’s like a real-time imagery exercise: you note all of your senses as you do something soothing. \"It could be having a cup of tea and noticing its warmth in your hands, the scent of the tea, and the way it feels going down your throat,\" Dr. Ramchandani says, \"Or it could be taking a mindful shower or a leisurely and mindful walk through nature.\" Take a brisk walk. Getting 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is important for all aspects of health, including stress management. But even a quick 10-minute walk when you’re feeling triggered can help \"burn off\" stress hormones, counter muscle tension, and release the body’s feel-good chemicals, which promote relaxation. If arthritis or another condition make walking difficult, ask your doctor about other aerobic exercises you may be able to do. Use laughter. \"Laughter has been referred to as ‘internal jogging’ by Dr. William Fry, and may provide a source of healing. It reduces stress hormones and becomes an expression of joy, optimism, and hope,\" Dr. Ramchandani says. \"Watch a movie or TV show that makes you laugh, maybe your favorite episode of ‘I Love Lucy.’\" Reduce loud noise in your environment. \"Loud noise triggers the stress response,\" Dr. Ramchandani notes. \"It makes it hard to think and takes you away from being mindful. If loud noise is unavoidable — perhaps because it comes from neighbors, traffic, or someone in your home or office — try wearing earplugs or noise-canceling headphones.\" Play soothing music. Unlike loud noise, pleasing music can help elicit the relaxation response. \"Music therapy can be very powerful for healing, and it is used in medical settings for everything from cancer treatment to recovering from COVID-19,\" Dr. Ramchandani says. \"But you need to be present and engaged in the sounds you’re hearing. If your mind is wandering to a stressful place, music won’t help.\" Counter negative thoughts. Positive thoughts help boost positive emotions. \"Find three positive things for one negative or stressful thought,\" Dr. Ramchandani suggests. \"Count your blessings, such as a safe place to live, a nice meal, and heat for your home during cold weather,\" she says. Use positive self-talk. \"When you’re self-critical, that automatically activates the stress response. If you give yourself praise and support, it helps reduce stress.\" Dr. Ramchandani says. Words to use: \"You can do this. You’re smart and strong and you’ve done bigger things before. Even if things don’t go your way, you’re doing the best you can.\" Ask if it’s really worth it. Try to put things in perspective by asking if the cause of your stress will matter a year from now, or if it’s worth the health problems that stress can cause. \"As soon as you realize that something may not be as important as you thought, it buffers stress,\" Dr. Ramchandani says. Reach out for help. We all want to be independent, but it’s okay to ask a friend or family member to simply listen to your concerns or to help you with activities, such as getting groceries, mowing the lawn, or lifting something heavy. Relieving a burden — either physical or mental — will help reduce stress. Another resource is the Harvard Special Health Report Stress Management (/sc). \n",

      "Stress is a natural reaction to specific demands and events, but ongoing stress can affect a person’s health and wellbeing. Tips for managing stress include exercise, setting priorities, counseling, and more. These demands can come from work, relationships, financial pressures, and other situations, but anything that poses a real or perceived challenge or threat to a person’s well-being can cause stress. Stress can be a motivator, and it can even be essential to survival. The body’s fight-or-flight mechanism tells a person when and how to respond to danger. However, when the body becomes triggered too easily, or there are too many stressors at one time, it can undermine a person’s mental and physical health and become harmful. Stress is the body’s natural defense against predators and danger. It causes the body to flood with hormones that prepare its systems to evade or confront danger. People commonly refer to this as the fight-or-flight mechanism. When humans face a challenge or threat, they have a partly physical response. The body activates resources that help people either stay and confront the challenge or get to safety as fast as possible. The body produces larger quantities of the chemicals cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These trigger the following physical reactions: These factors all improve a person’s ability to respond to a potentially hazardous or challenging situation. Norepinephrine and epinephrine also cause a faster heart rate.  Environmental factors that trigger this reaction are called stressors. Examples include noises, aggressive behavior, a speeding car, scary moments in movies, or even going out on a first date. Feelings of stress tend to increase in tandem with the number of stressors. According to the American Psychological Association (APA)’s annual stress survey in 2018, average stress levels in the United States were 4.9 on a scale from 1 to 10. The survey found that the most common stressors were employment and money. Visit our dedicated hub for more research-backed information and resources on mental health and well-being. Stress slows down some normal bodily functions, such as those that the digestive and immune systems perform. The body can then concentrate its resources on breathing, blood flow, alertness, and the preparation of the muscles for sudden use. The body changes in the following ways during a stress reaction: How a person reacts to a difficult situation will determine the effects of stress on overall health. Some people can experience several stressors in a row or at once without this leading a severe stress reaction. Others may have a stronger response to a single stressor. An individual who feels as though they do not have enough resources to cope will probably have a stronger reaction that could trigger health problems. Stressors affect individuals in different ways. Some experiences that people generally consider to be positive can lead to stress, such as having a baby, going on vacation, moving to a better home, and getting a promotion at work. The reason for this is that they typically involve a significant change, extra effort, new responsibilities, and a need for adaptation. They also often require a person to take steps into the unknown.  A person may look forward to an increased salary following a promotion, for example, but wonder whether they can handle the extra responsibilities. A persistently negative response to challenges can have an adverse effect on health and happiness.  For example, a 2018 review of studies found associations between work-related stress and coronary heart disease. Despite this, the authors could not confirm the exact mechanisms through which stress causes coronary heart disease. Other literature has shown that people who perceive stress as having a negative effect on their health may be at higher risk for coronary heart disease than those who do not.  However, being more alert to the effects of stress may help a person manage it more effectively and cope better. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) recognize two types of stress: acute and chronic. These require different levels of management.  The NIMH also identify three examples of types of stressor: This type of stress is short-term and usually the more common form of stress. Acute stress often develops when people consider the pressures of events that have recently occurred or face upcoming challenges in the near future. For example, a person may feel stressed about a recent argument or an upcoming deadline. However, the stress will reduce or disappear once a person resolves the argument or meets the deadline. Acute stressors are often new and tend to have a clear and immediate solution. Even with the more difficult challenges that people face, there are possible ways to get out of the situation. Acute stress does not cause the same amount of damage as long-term, chronic stress. Short-term effects include tension headaches and an upset stomach, as well as a moderate amount of distress. However, repeated instances of acute stress over an extended period can become chronic and harmful. This type of stress develops over a long period and is more harmful. Ongoing poverty, a dysfunctional family, or an unhappy marriage are examples of situations that can cause chronic stress. It occurs when a person can see no way to avoid their stressors and stops seeking solutions. A traumatic experience early in life may also contribute to chronic stress. Chronic stress makes it difficult for the body to return to a normal level of stress hormone activity, which can contribute to problems in the following systems: A constant state of stress can also increase a person’s risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can develop when stress becomes chronic. Chronic stress can continue unnoticed, as people can become used to feeling agitated and hopeless. It can become part of an individual’s personality, making them constantly prone to the effects of stress regardless of the scenarios that they encounter. People with chronic stress are at risk of having a final breakdown that can lead to suicide, violent actions, a heart attack, or stroke. People react differently to stressful situations. What is stressful for one person may not be stressful for another, and almost any event can potentially cause stress. For some people, just thinking about a trigger or several smaller triggers can cause stress. There is no identifiable reason why one person may feel less stressed than another when facing the same stressor. Mental health conditions, such as depression, or a building sense of frustration, injustice, and anxiety can make some people feel stressed more easily than others. Previous experiences may affect how a person reacts to stressors. Common major life events that can trigger stress include: Other commonly reported causes of stress are: Some people experience ongoing stress after a traumatic event, such as an accident or some kind of abuse. Doctors will diagnose this as PTSD.  Those who work in stressful jobs, such as the military or the emergency services, will have a debriefing session following a major incident, and occupational healthcare services will monitor them for PTSD. The physical effects of stress can include: A 2012 study found that the stressors that parents experience, such as financial troubles or managing a single-parent household, may also lead to obesity in their children. Emotional reactions can include: Stress-associated behaviors include: If stress becomes chronic, it can lead to several complications, including A doctor will typically diagnose stress by asking an individual about their symptoms and life events. Diagnosing stress can be challenging because it depends on many factors. Doctors have used questionnaires, biochemical measures, and physiological techniques to identify stress. However, these may not be objective or effective. The most direct way to diagnose stress and its effects on a person is through a comprehensive, stress-oriented, face-to-face interview. Treatment includes self-help and, when an underlying condition is causing stress, certain medications. Therapies that may help a person relax include aromatherapy and reflexology. Some insurance providers cover this type of treatment. However, it is important for people to check coverage with their provider before pursuing this treatment. Knowing the details about a potential treatment can help prevent it from adding to any ongoing stress. Doctors will not usually prescribe medications for coping with stress, unless they are treating an underlying illness, such as depression or an anxiety disorder. In such cases, they may prescribe an antidepressant. However, there is a risk that the medication will only mask the stress, rather than help the person deal with it. Antidepressants can also have adverse effects, and they may worsen some complications of stress, such as low libido. Developing coping strategies before stress becomes chronic or severe can help an individual manage new situations and maintain their physical and mental health. People who are already experiencing overwhelming stress should seek medical assistance. People may find that the following lifestyle measures can help them manage or prevent stress-induced feelings of being overwhelmed. Noticing signs and symptoms is the first step to taking action. People who experience work stress due to long hours may need to “take a step back.” It may be time for them to review their working practices or talk to a supervisor about finding ways to reduce the load. Most people have an activity that helps them relax, such as reading a book, going for a walk, listening to music, or spending time with a friend, loved one, or pet. Joining a choir or a gym also helps some people relax. The APA encourage people to develop networks of social support, for example, by talking to neighbors and others in the local community or joining a club, charity, or religious organization. Those who often feel as though they do not have the time or energy for hobbies should try some enjoyable new activities that make them feel good. People can turn to their support network if they need ideas. Being part of a group can reduce the risk of stress developing and provide support and practical help when challenging circumstances develop. People who find that stress is affecting their daily life should seek professional help. A doctor or psychiatric specialist can often help, for example, through stress management training. Stress management can help by: Stress management therapy pursues one or more of these approaches. People can develop their stress management techniques by using self-help books or online resources. Alternatively, they can attend a stress management course.  A counselor or psychotherapist can connect an individual who has stress with personal development courses or individual and group therapy sessions. Read the article in Spanish.

      "Feeling upset but don’t know why? There might be an underlying cause, such as hormonal changes, past trauma, depression, or stress. If you find yourself feeling low or crying without an obvious reason, you might wonder what’s going on. This is often nothing to worry about — you might just be feeling extra sensitive today.  In some cases, there may be a cause you haven’t thought of yet. Feeling sad is a natural part of life. In fact, sadness has some benefits, like helping us process difficult events and connect with others. But that doesn’t always make it easier in the moment. However you feel today, know that you’re not alone and there are many ways to find joy again.  People feel sad for lots of reasons — but it’s also possible to feel sad for no reason that you can think of. Sometimes, a seemingly small disappointment can affect you more than you think, leaving you upset long afterward. You might not connect your current sadness to what happened. Feeling lonely, experiencing rejection, and having relationship issues can all have a major and lasting effect on how you feel.  Even a lack of sleep or feeling hungry can put you in a sour mood some days. In other cases, there might be a deeper cause. Factors like depression, trauma, grief, and hormonal changes can affect your mood without your conscious awareness for years, yet they may affect your emotions every day. Consider setting time aside to sit with your emotions and work out what’s causing them. You may not find the answer, and that’s OK — but sometimes, finding and naming the cause can help you accept your feelings and move toward happiness. Below, we look at some reasons you might be feeling sad and tips for boosting your mood. Depression, also called major depressive disorder (MDD) or clinical depression, is characterized by a low mood and loss of interest in things you usually enjoy that lasts for at least 2 weeks. Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reports that about 8.4% of adults in the United States have experienced depression. Other symptoms of depression include:  If you think you have depression but aren’t sure if it’s MDD, you might want to read about other types of depression, too.  A type of depression called persistent depressive disorder (PDD), or dysthymia, is depression that lasts for 2 years or more. People who experience it might not remember a time when they didn’t feel sad.  If you only feel sad for seemingly no reason during a specific part of the year, it could be a type of depression called seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or depression with seasonal features. SAD is more common during the fall and winter when days are shorter. Trauma is an emotional or physical response to one or more harmful or life threatening events or circumstances with lasting adverse effects on your mental and physical well-being, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA). Trauma can affect your brain and nervous system, and many people experience emotional dysregulation long after the traumatic situation is over.  Emotional dysregulation can look like this: If you find yourself affected by a traumatic event long after it ends — such as intrusive memories or avoiding situations that remind you of the trauma — you may be living with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex PTSD. Changes in your reproductive hormone levels can cause mood changes, including feeling down or upset.  In those cases, you might be unable to figure out why you’re sad because hormonal changes happen without conscious awareness. Various mood-altering issues that stem from shifting reproductive hormone levels include:  When your depression symptoms have a hormonal cause, they may ease when your hormone levels readjust, but sometimes they can linger. It’s often worth speaking with a mental health professional to help support you through these periods.  Sometimes you’ll feel sad when you’re dealing with a specific problem in your life. High levels of stress can lead to emotional dysregulation and unpredictable mood shifts in anyone. In fact, stress can have both mental and physical effects. Stressful or upsetting situations might include: Once you adjust to the change or cope with the situation, the feelings will likely go away. If you are having trouble adjusting to the situation consider speaking with a mental health professional. When you feel sad, various methods can offer relief and help you find joy again.  Sometimes people feel sad for no obvious reason, and that’s OK. The feelings often pass.  If you feel sad often, find it hard to deal with your mood, or think you have a mental health condition it can help to speak with a mental health professional. A primary care doctor can be a good first step, too.  Want to learn more about starting therapy? Psych Central’s How to Find Mental Health Support resource can help.

      "Sadness is a natural emotion that everyone experiences at various times in their life. Feeling sad for no reason may be related to hormonal changes, lack of sleep, stress, or other factors. Sadness can affect people in different ways. People may want to cry, spend time alone, or do other comfort-related activities until they feel happier. Occasional sadness is normal. However, feeling sad for more than 2 weeks, or sadness affecting everyday functioning, may indicate a more serious underlying cause, such as depression.  This article explores why a person may feel sad for no apparent reason, tips for feeling happier, and when to speak with a doctor about feeling sad.  Fluctuations in hormones can significantly affect a person’s mood and sometimes lead to unexplained sadness.  Hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle, including fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, can affect someone’s mood each month. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is common and can make a person feel sad at the start of menstruation.  According to the Office on Women’s Health, feelings of sadness, known as the baby blues, typically last a few days after birth and occur due to hormonal fluctuations coupled with new challenges.  However, if sadness persists for longer than 2 weeks, the person may have postpartum depression. Depression after pregnancy affects 1 in 8 people that give birth. People going through puberty also experience hormonal changes, which may cause them to feel sad. These hormone shifts are a natural part of adolescence and can vary in intensity from one person to another.  Hormonal changes can cause the following symptoms: Treatment options for sadness due to hormone fluctuations may involve talk therapy, support groups, and, in some people, medication. Sleep is essential for emotional well-being. Lack of sleep can lead to feelings of worry, frustration, and anger, among other emotions.  Chronic sleep deprivation can alter brain activity and make it difficult to control emotions and cope with daily problems.  Signs that someone is not getting enough sleep may include the following: Establishing good sleep habits may help a person experiencing sadness and other mood changes due to lack of sleep. These may include: Life always has some level of stress, but sometimes, a person may experience events that cause higher levels of stress. Excessive stress can cause someone to feel unexplained sadness and other negative emotions. Signs that someone might be feeling high levels of stress include the following: The following lifestyle changes may help someone cope with stress: Grief is a natural reaction to experiencing loss. The loss may be the death of a loved one, ending a close relationship, or going through a major life change.  Having a wide range of emotions, including sadness, during this time is common.  As well as feelings of sadness, signs of grief can include: Grief may linger for a while. Here are some possible ways a person can work through grief: As the days shorten and temperatures drop, some people may experience winter blues. The change in season may bring on feelings of sadness, shortened tempers, and feelings of lethargy.  While these feelings can be temporary, some people may experience extreme sadness to the point that it becomes disabling.  Experts call this seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that lasts during the winter season and goes away during the rest of the year. Sadness due to seasonal changes may result in the following symptoms when winter arrives: The American Psychological Association recommends the following tips to cope with seasonal sadness: Unexplained sadness that lasts more than 2 weeks may be a symptom of an underlying medical condition. Mental health conditions that may cause sadness include: Mental illness can affect anyone at any age. These conditions can affect a person’s mood, thinking, and behaviors. They can also impact a person’s day-to-day living and personal relationships.  Each mental illness has unique symptoms, but here are some common generalized symptoms.  Treating mental disorders may involve talking with a professional, taking medications, and participating in therapy.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NAMI), self-care can help a person improve their emotional and mental well-being. The following self-care tips may help someone feel happier: Feeling sad on occasion is a normal part of life. However, a person should not ignore sadness that is persistent and unexplainable.  If someone experiences prolonged or severe sadness, they should speak with a healthcare professional.

      "Feeling sad all the time for no specific reason doesn’t always mean you have depression, but it does suggest you could be experiencing something more complex than sadness alone. Sadness is a temporary state that often has a clear cause, like a big disappointment, the loss of someone close to you, or bad news from someone you love.  This type of sadness can fluctuate throughout the day. In certain moments, the emotional burden might feel particularly heavy. You might cry often, feel numb or drained, and struggle to concentrate.  At other times — when you get lost in something you enjoy or when a loved one distracts you — your sorrow may seem light enough that you can barely feel its weight. While it might linger in some form for days or weeks, it generally begins to ease naturally. Persistent sadness is something else entirely. It can wrap around you like a heavy blanket, muffling the sensations and joy of everyday life. This sadness can leave you feeling low, empty, and defeated. You don’t know what caused your unhappiness, so you have no idea how to start feeling better. Feeling sad isn’t at all unusual. After all, sorrow is a normal human response to disappointment and loss. Sadness that doesn’t have a clear reason behind it and doesn’t seem to improve, however, may suggest something else is going on. While not everyone with depression will feel sad, unexplainable sadness you can’t seem to shake is one of the primary signs of depression.  If your sadness does relate to depression, you’ll likely feel sad nearly all of the time — almost every day, for most of each day, for a period of 2 weeks or longer. Sadness, in other words, seems to become a constant companion.  With depression, you’ll experience other symptoms, too. If several of the signs below accompany your sad or tearful mood, there’s a good chance you’re dealing with depression: Chronic sadness, especially when related to depression, might also prompt regular thoughts of death or suicide. Even if you don’t have a plan to act on these thoughts, it’s always best to talk to someone you trust and get support right away (more on how to do this later).  You might begin to notice your feelings of sadness, along with any other symptoms you experience, follow a specific pattern. Depression can take different forms, and various underlying factors can have an impact on the way your symptoms show up.  A few things to look for: People living with bipolar disorder often experience episodes of depression as part of a cycle that also includes episodes of mania or hypomania.  You might notice you suddenly feel intensely happy, even euphoric. This abrupt change in mood might also involve: This episode might last a week, or longer.  Somewhere around 40 percent of people with bipolar disorder have what’s known as mixed features. You could experience sadness and other symptoms of depression at the same time as mania.  This combination of symptoms can make it harder to understand what you’re experiencing, which could add to your distress.  Maybe your sadness seems to arrive or intensify around the same time of year the days begin to shorten. Once the longer, sunnier days of spring and summer arrive, you feel better, year after year. It’s pretty common to feel a little low in autumn and winter. The nights get long and cold, and there are plenty of days when you may not even see the sun. If this seasonal sadness persists and becomes serious enough to affect daily life, you could have seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that occurs along with seasonal changes.  Along with other common depression symptoms, you might also notice: Reproductive hormones can also play a part in depression symptoms, so tracking what time of the month symptoms show up can offer some important clues.  Symptoms of depression often become serious enough to get in the way of everyday functioning, but that isn’t always the case.  With most forms of depression, periods of sadness might last a few weeks or longer, depending on the type of depression you have, and then lift temporarily. You might not feel sad or notice any other symptoms for some time.  With persistent depressive disorder (PDD), on the other hand, mood symptoms won’t show up in clear episodes. Instead, they often last for years. With PDD, you may no longer recall a time when you didn’t feel somewhat sad or depressed. You might: Unlike symptoms of major depression, symptoms of PDD may not prevent you from living your daily life. Still, as you work, go to school, and take care of your regular responsibilities. you’ll likely notice an ever-present sad or low mood.  When sadness tints every aspect of your day-to-day an unrelenting gray, you might have trouble finding relief. Feeling down can also make it more difficult to brainstorm potentially helpful changes, which is why professional support can make a big difference (more on this in a moment).  In the meantime, these strategies may offer a bit of relief. Many of the symptoms associated with sadness or depression can prompt you to pull back from others rather than seek emotional support.  When feeling irritable, you might get frustrated with loved ones easily. You might experience guilt over negative feelings toward others, your need to cancel plans, or your disinterest in your usual activities. It’s also fairly common to find yourself doubting whether loved ones actually care about you and want to spend time with you.  Isolating yourself will generally only worsen sadness, though, so sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help a lot. Even opening up to just one close friend or family member can help you feel less alone.  Talking won’t necessarily make your symptoms go away, but it can help the burden seem lighter. You’ll also have someone you can turn to if you need additional support.  People commonly use humor as a method of coping with depression and other mental health conditions.  Even when you don’t feel much like laughing or cracking jokes, funny books, YouTube videos, or your favorite comedy program can often take the edge off your sadness and help raise your spirits.  Not a fan of comedy? Taking a beloved book off the shelf or curling up with a nostalgic movie can sometimes offer similar benefits.  Music offers a number of mental health benefits, including temporary relief from sadness and other symptoms of depression. It can help energize you, so you could also see some improvements in any fatigue you’re experiencing.  Listening to music can encourage your brain to produce hormones like dopamine and serotonin. These “happy hormones” have been linked to improvements in mood and reduced anxiety and stress. Just try to avoid music that matches your mood. Wallowing can seem like a good way to get those feelings out, but mournful tunes might end up worsening sadness or depression. Aim for upbeat music with a faster tempo.  Your favorite hobbies may seem less enjoyable when you feel sad or down, but giving them a try anyway can sometimes offer mood-boosting benefits.  If you’re struggling to muster up any energy, try low-key activities instead of ones that you feel exhausted just thinking about. A few possibilities:  “Have you tried going outside?” can sound like something a well-meaning loved one with no real knowledge of mood disorders might say. Yet while sunlight won’t completely cure feelings of sadness or depression, regular sun exposure can make a difference for both physical and mental well-being. Experts believe sunlight prompts your brain to produce serotonin. When you have lower levels of this hormone in your system, you’re more likely to feel depressed, especially as fall and winter roll around. Spending more time in the sun, then, can increase serotonin and potentially relieve sadness.  Exercise can also offer some mood-boosting benefits, so if you feel up to it, combine your sun exposure with a walk around your neighborhood or in your favorite park. Can’t get outside easily? Little sun to speak of? Light therapy with a SAD lamp can help you get some artificial sun that still offers very real benefits.  Coping strategies won’t always help relieve sadness. If nothing seems to help you find relief, it may be time to talk to a therapist or other healthcare professional. Professional support is always recommended when symptoms: It’s important to get help right away if you have thoughts of death, dying, or suicide. Therapy offers a safe space to address and manage these thoughts over the long term, but in-the-moment support may be more helpful if you’re experiencing distressing thoughts during a mental health crisis. You can find a therapist in your area with a quick Google search, using a therapist directory, or by asking a primary care provider for a referral. When talking with a healthcare professional, be sure to tell them about any patterns you’ve noticed with your symptoms, including seasonal mood changes or cycles between extreme sadness and extreme elation. Also, consider keeping track of changing moods and emotions in a journal. This helps express and sort through feelings at the moment, but it also creates a log of symptoms you can share with your care team. Feeling sad all the time for no specific reason doesn’t always mean you have depression, but it does suggest you could be experiencing something more complex than sadness alone. When sadness lingers and becomes more of a fixed state of being, talking to a therapist can have a lot of benefits. In the meantime, be gentle with yourself and try to remember that this feeling won’t last forever. Crystal Raypole has previously worked as a writer and editor for GoodTherapy.

      " We all have days where we feel down and sometimes feeling sad can happen for no apparent reason. Occasionally, sadness is natural but other times it isn’t and perhaps it is a symptom of depression. The good news is that there are plenty of useful tools available for people living with unexplained sadness. One of our psychologists Dr Jessica Valentine explains the possible reasons behind feeling sad and what you can do to make yourself feel better.  It is normal to feel low and not understand where it is coming from. Sometimes we have memories that have been deep rooted from our childhood or a painful situation that you might have blocked out. People feel low for various reasons. I know that I feel low in the wintertime because there isn’t enough sun. I manage this through diet, exercise, meditation and travelling.\n",

      "Feeling low after a loss, a breakup, or ‘for no reason at all’ is all normal. When you work with a psychologist like myself, we can piece all of the information together to find out what is ‘triggering’ you to feel this way. Often people feel low because they are not happy in their life or can feel like their life is mundane. We can help restore the balance in your life using a few simple techniques.\n",
      "  A sudden low mood or sadness can be a sign of depression. There are various types of depression. Someone could be feeling melancholy, which is feeling low without knowing why or on the other side of the spectrum someone could have symptoms of severe depression which could have been a result of having trauma in one's life. I have had clients who had been feeling low because they had a vitamin deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, anxiety can play a huge role in depression. We might feel anxious, shame or guilt ourselves and then we feel ‘bad’ about it. This is how depression plays a role in anxiety and when someone has mixed episodes with anxiety and depression. This is why it is so important to understand how mindfulness works. Mindfulness works by being aware of your own body, being aware of others around you and focusing on your body’s breathing and sensations.\n",
      "  Depression and sadness are different. Sadness is a symptom of depression. Other symptoms of depression are anger, frustration, avoidance and the feeling of being stuck. Not everyone will have similar symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is normal or ‘atypical’ to feel sad sometimes. Other feelings such as anger, happiness, frustration, annoyance or agitation are all okay to feel. Sometimes when we have strong feelings or emotions it can affect our personal relationships, work, and home life. This is when we need to learn other ways to handle or deal with these emotions in a healthier, proactive kind of way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DSM-V Psychological Diagnostic manual recognises nine categories of depression. The areas of depression that someone might fall under would be major depression, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder, psychotic depression, postpartum depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, situational depression and atypical depression. Each one of these categories has its own unique symptoms.\n",

      "Everyone feels sad sometimes, just like everyone can feel joyful, angry, proud and plenty of other emotions. In other words, everyone has feelings, and those feelings are always changing. Sometimes we feel happy (such as when we’re having fun) and sometimes we feel sad (such as when we lose a loved one). Whatever the feelings, it is real and part of living.  A negative emotion may even help you. Our world focuses on happiness and treats unhappiness as an unnecessary or useless feeling. But sadness can slow you down, and make you really think about your life, your feelings and the people around you. It can help you keep sight of your relationships and dreams.  In other words, being sad doesn’t mean you are not coping with a situation. Rather, it helps you come to terms with that situation and move on. It is an important emotion that can help you adapt, accept, focus, persevere and grow. And there’s more good news: you can learn to manage your sadness.  We use different words to talk about sadness: agony, anguish, broken heart, hurt, sorrow, dejection, dismay, homesickness, distress, unhappiness and more. All these emotions can occur in response to a negative or unexpected situations, or life changes.   Sadness often occurs at the same time as other feelings, such as anger, stress, guilt, grief, anxiety or hopelessness. Sometimes, the other feeling may be so strong that you don’t realise you are sad. \n",
      "So what does sadness feel like? It may change how you feel physically. Perhaps you have a stomach ache or a headache, or you can’t sleep.  Sadness may also change how you feel emotionally. Perhaps you are teary, grumpy, bored or frustrated, or just keen to avoid other people.  But recognising your sadness, and understanding that it is okay to feel sad, is a sign of a stable sense of wellbeing.  Life is full of situations that may make people feel sad: When you face these situations, you may have unhelpful or negative thoughts about your sadness. And those thoughts can make you feel worse.  So, try a different approach: try to acknowledge your sadness and the situation that prompted it. And give yourself time to deal with any problems and feel better. You also may want to call on resources that could help you (such as friends and family, a psychologist, or another health professional). Feeling better can involve taking one step or many. It may happen quickly or over a long time. Just remember that emotions ebb and flow, and you can move through sadness to a more positive emotion. First, acknowledge that you are feeling sad. Sometimes sadness may feel manageable, and acknowledging how you feel is enough – after all, it will pass over time. Sometimes you might want to actively do something to help manage your sadness. You may want to try some of these tips: Maybe you know someone else who is feeling sad. Being supportive isn't always easy, because it’s sometimes hard to know why someone is sad and how they are coping.  Here are four basic tips: For more ideas about how to support someone who is sad, read the tips from  beyondblueExternal Link  . Feeling sad does not mean you have depression. But if your mood starts to interrupt your life and how you function, then you may have become depressed.  Key differences between sadness and clinical depression relate to the cause for the change in mood and how long you have felt that way, and other symptoms that might be present.  If your mood relates to a recent event, such as a relationship breakup, then you may well be feeling sadness. But if that breakup was months ago, or you can see no clear reason for your change in mood, you could be depressed, and it might be helpful for you to chat to your GP about what’s causing you to feel the way you do.

Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test Jump to section 6 differences between sadness and depression 12 things to do when you are sad to feel better 3 signs to look out for Reclaiming the sunshine Building strong coping strategies helps you heal and brings you the resilience you need to work through big feelings.  But sometimes, you don’t know what tools you need until you need them. Maybe your usual methods of thwarting sadness aren't doing enough to lessen the emotional weight, or you’re mentally exhausted and can’t muster the energy to reflect and heal.  Everyone experiences sadness, but knowing what to do when you’re sad makes all the difference in moving on and learning how to cope and when to reach out for help. This understanding helps channel your emotions into self-care, fostering a sense of well-being and, ideally, peace. Sadness is normal. But when it becomes so extreme or constant that it affects your life negatively, it might signal a larger mental health issue like depression.  According to a review from Medical News Today, sadness isn’t classified as a psychiatric disorder because it passes with time. It usually stems from specific events, like a romantic breakup or the loss of a loved one. On the other hand, clinical depression is a diagnosable mental disorder unrelated to specific events, with sadness as one of its major symptoms. Before you tackle what to do when you feel depressed, you need to explore the difference between sadness and depression. The goal isn’t to self-diagnose, but to self-reflect and consider whether speaking to a mental health professional is the right call.   Here are some differences between sadness and depression, according to Medical News Today:  If you’re sad and grappling with how to make yourself feel better, having a roadmap can help you follow a path to a better mood. Here are some strategies to guide you: Guilt sometimes accompanies sadness, especially if you know other people are worried about you. But feeling sad isn’t a sign of personal failure. It’s a universal human experience and a normal response to certain life events.  Instead of blaming yourself or feeling guilty for your emotional distress, view the purpose of sadness as a natural part of life's journey. Try journaling or starting a conversation with friends to reassure yourself that the feeling is normal. This acceptance can open the door to better understanding and emotional regulation without the burden of judgment or self-pity.  Being kind to yourself isn’t an indulgence. It's essential to maintaining health and well-being, even when you’re sad. Spend time with yourself as you would with a friend if they were upset. This could involve engaging in activities that make you happy or practicing self-care.  Remember, whether it's soaking in a hot bath, immersing yourself in a good book, or taking a mindful walk in nature, these activities are never a waste of time. They're important tools to take care of your mental health and remind yourself that life is more than sadness.  One powerful form of self-help is expressing your feelings through writing or anxiety journaling. Penning your emotions in a private place offers a safe space to acknowledge and explore your feelings. This process brings clarity and helps you identify the sources of your sadness if you’re unsure. Think of it as a self-guided exploration, offering insights into your emotional landscape. Rather than pushing your sad feelings aside or trying to cover them up, allow yourself to feel them. Experiencing a range of emotions is an integral part of being human — and that includes sadness.  It’s easier said than done, but embrace these feelings and learn how to improve your emotions instead of resisting them. Speak with a friend, coach, or therapist, and be honest about what’s going on. That truth is the first step to healing. Simple breathing exercises or meditation practices are excellent ways to calm yourself down, and they can work wonders for all types of stress and anxiety. When you focus on your breath, you ground yourself in the present moment, creating a sense of stability that can alleviate feelings of sadness. Sometimes people cry at work, around friends or family, or alone. And studies show it’s actually good for you because it releases happy hormones. If you feel the urge to cry, allow yourself that release. It's a form of emotional expression that offers relief and healing.  Pursue activities that bring you joy and lift your spirits, even if you don’t feel like doing them in the moment. Whether dancing in your living room, playing with your pet, or simply enjoying a cup of your favorite tea, find happiness in small moments.  Painting, writing, or gardening are great ways to express your emotions and lift your spirits. They can help you navigate and eventually work through your feelings, or simply offer a distraction if that’s what you need. Think outside the box and find something that ignites your passion.  Music can help you concentrate and significantly influence your mood. A song with a positive message or an uplifting beat can remind you of the things you love, offering an easy and enjoyable way to combat feelings of sadness. Turn on one of your favorite songs and let the music flow. According to a study by JAMA Psychiatry, just 15 minutes of running per day reduces your chances of depression. But exercise benefits don’t just stem from running or jogging. Any movement adds up to keep negative feelings at bay, so moving your body more in any way throughout the day positively impacts your mood.  University of Pennsylvania researchers found that individuals limited to 4.5 hours of sleep a night for one week reported more anger, sadness, and mental exhaustion. Inadequate sleep causes irritability and stress, so prioritizing is essential to stabilizing your mood. Take a look at your sleep hygiene habits and try to find ways to get more rest. Sharing your feelings with a trusted individual can provide tremendous relief. They might not know what to say to someone who is sad, but that isn’t the point. This is about vocalizing your emotions and being vulnerable, allowing someone else to offer support, understanding, and a fresh perspective if they have it.  Remember, if your sadness feels overwhelming or persists, don't hesitate to contact a mental health organization. It's not a sign of weakness but an essential step toward well-being.  If you’re managing feelings of sadness, it's important to know what signs might indicate a deeper mental health issue. Here are a few to look out for: Persistent sadness: It's normal to have periods of feeling down. But if you're constantly asking yourself, “Why am I sad for no reason?” or if the sadness doesn’t seem to lift, it could signal a more severe condition like clinical depression. This could be an enduring low mood that interferes with daily activities, impacts your relationships, or leads to physical symptoms of depression like a change in appetite or sleep patterns. These signs aren't something to feel guilty or embarrassed about. They're indicators that it's time to ask for help, which is a courageous step. Mental health conditions, including depression, aren't character flaws. They're real health issues that you can manage with the right treatment. Learning how to deal with sadness isn't easy, but you're not alone.  If you’re wondering what to do when you’re sad, focus on the things that bring you joy, seek help when you need it, and remember that it's okay to feel sad. You have the power to navigate these feelings, and with these strategies, you'll be well on your way to reclaiming your sunshine.   Content Marketing Manager, ACC 3100 E 5th Street, Suite 350  Austin, TX 78702 How it works Products Solutions Customers Resources\n"

      " Most people wish there was a magic pill, button, or phrase to make hurt vacate your soul, but there isn’t. Too bad there isn’t, because a lot of people want to know how to stop being sad.  Everyone goes through ups and downs. But sometimes, feeling blue can spiral into depression. Some people even become comfortable being alone and miserable; they just adjust to it. But that shouldn’t happen to you. Feeling blue isn’t bad, and it’s going to happen from time to time, but you don’t want it to turn into your primary emotion. It’s okay, every now and again, to wallow in self-pity, eat a bucket of ice cream, and cry. But then, at some point, you need to take a shower and go outside. So, if you feel like you can’t get out of the blues, try out some of these tips to help you feel better. Feeling sad is usually a temporary feeling that has a cause. For example, you could have just experienced a big disappointment, such as losing someone you love or hearing bad news about something. Such sadness can also include feelings such as grief or sorrow. [Read: How to not cry – 29 fastest ways to stop those mad or sad tears] Feelings of sadness can also stem from poor self-worth. Feeling good about ourselves is core to our inner happiness. When we have self-love, it is less likely that you will become sad for no reason. These feelings of sadness can fluctuate. It can change day by day or even throughout the same day. You might cry, feel numb, or struggle to concentrate. But at other times, you might immerse yourself in something you enjoy or be distracted by a loved one. Sadness is normal because it’s temporary and fluctuates. But persistent sadness is a different problem. It will prevent you from feeling the joy of everyday life, and, over time, feeling like this will make you feel empty and defeated. [Read: 30 signs of low self-esteem in a woman that reveal a need for self-love] If you’re feeling persistent sadness, you might not even know the cause, so you have no idea how to stop feeling sad. Feeling sad from time to time isn’t unusual. After all, we all experience disappointment and loss during our lives, so it’s a natural response to that. But you should be in touch with yourself enough to know if it’s temporary or if it’s something that is not going away. As we just discussed, there is temporary sadness and persistent sadness. Usually, people can identify the cause of temporary sadness.  That’s because it’s usually some event or outside force that is making us feel that way. [Read: Painful stages of heartbreak and grief all of us go through after a breakup] Examples of causes of temporary sadness are a breakup, getting fired, rude friends, unexpected bills, or things along those lines. These are things that take away your happiness, but they will eventually go away with time.  On the other hand, persistent sadness can either result from some of these same causes or from no causes at all. That is what is the most frustrating about it – many people can’t pinpoint the root cause of their sadness when it becomes persistent. They could have a great life with plenty of loving friends and family, but they still feel sad. In this case, it is probably some sort of chemical imbalance in their brain that is causing the sadness. [Read: Why are women so emotional? 18 reasons they feel deeper than men] What makes one person feel sad might not make another person feel sad. So, the causes of sadness are unique to every individual. The reason for this is that everyone has their own tolerance level and coping strategies.  For example, if maybe one person flunked a test, it could throw them into a tizzy for a week. But another person who flunked the same test might just feel the sting of seeing the “F” grade for a few minutes and then forget about it. People are less likely to feel sad if they have a positive attitude about life. If you are generally happy and an optimist, then you are more able to change your perspective and viewpoint about what happens to you. You quickly talk yourself out of feelings of sadness because you have those mental and emotional skills. [Read: Positive self-talk – what it is, where it comes from, and how to master it] Other people don’t have that ability. Instead, they let what happens to them affect them on a much deeper level. When this happens, it’s more difficult to move past those feelings and stop feeling sad and become happy again. As you can see, causes of sadness don’t have as much to do with what happens to you but rather is dependent upon your own inner ability to move past it.  Many people confuse sadness and depression, thinking they are the same thing. But they’re not. While the feelings are similar, there are some differences that are important to note. [Read: How to live in the moment – 24 positive ways to live in the now] As we discussed above, sadness is a temporary state that comes and goes as negative situations also come and go in our lives. Sadness repeats itself in everyone’s lives. But there are also spans of happiness and joy in between.  Feelings of sadness aren’t that deep, depending on the circumstances. Of course, the death of a loved one will make your feelings of sadness and grief linger. But in day-to-day life, the cause isn’t as serious, and a person gets over it relatively quickly. However, if you are feeling sadness for a long time that won’t go away with no known cause, then that’s depression. This requires assistance, support, or maybe even medication.  Depression is chronic and usually doesn’t ever go away completely. [Read: How to help someone when they’re feeling down and depressed] Depression can make a person take less care of themselves, make them lethargic, and affect their appetite. It can make it difficult for someone to take care of themselves. In extreme cases, depression can be accompanied by feelings of suicide. Some of us are hit with way more adversity than others. Some handle it, while others can’t. The key to knowing how to stop being sad is knowing that nothing lasts forever, which is a good thing.  Sadness and joy both come and go.

      "Sadness can be a difficult emotion to manage, but there are plenty of situations where feeling that way is a perfectly natural reactionâlike when youâve run into a setback or lost an important relationship. But when youâre feeling sad on a regular basis and you arenât sure why, that can be a sign that your mental health needs attention.  So how can you tell if what youâre experiencing is normal (even if unpleasant) sadness or an issue that needs addressing? Read on for some key differences to look for, plus tips for handling sadness whenever it happens.  Even sadness you canât explain can be a healthy reaction to your situation. For example, sadness can be your way of responding to a problem you havenât consciously noticed yet. But once you start feeling down, you look for the issue (and ideally, find a solution too).  Surprisingly, research shows that sadness can even improve your relationships with other people. Being in a bad mood can even make you more persuasive and less judgmental. Looking for a good example of how sadness can be beneficial? Talkiatry therapist Tracey Griffin has a movie recommendation for you. \"Inside Out does a wonderful job of showing how sadness can make people more empathetic,\" Tracey says. \"I often use this example to help my patients see how sharing their sadness with other people can actually strengthen their connection.\" But healthy sadness tends to subside after a few hours or days, once youâve solved or accepted the issue thatâs bothering you. Persistent sadness, on the other hand, can be a sign of a mental health concern.  Clinical depression can come in a few different forms. Major depressive disorder (MDD), often (but not always) causes near-constant sadness for more than two weeks at a time. That low mood might go away for a while, but it always comes back.  If you always seem to feel sad in the winter months but your mood brightens with the weather, you might have a different type of depression: seasonal affective disorder (SAD). On the other hand, persistent depressive disorder (PDD) causes year-round, but milder gloominess.  Apart from sadness, youâll recognize all types of depression by these symptoms:  If youâre relating to this as you read, it might be a good idea to reach out to a psychiatrist who can help you manage your symptoms.  Unlike depression, bipolar disorder doesnât just bring you down emotionally and physically. Instead, periods of persistent sadness alternate with spells of intense happiness. You might get a brief breather from your symptoms in between episodes, or you might feel depressed and euphoric at the same time.  During a depressive episode, youâll see the same kinds of symptoms that normally come along with clinical depression. Youâll recognize a manic episode by these symptoms:  If any of this sounds like you, consider reaching out to a psychiatrist for help.  Sometimes, a consistently down mood can be a side effect of a significant shift in your bodyâs hormone levels. You might always feel sad shortly before you get your period, or you might feel depressed for some time after giving birth, which is called postpartum depression. You can also develop depressive symptoms later in life, when your testosterone or estrogen levels drop.  In these cases, youâll experience all the usual symptoms of depression, so you may have a hard time connecting the change in your mood to whatâs going on inside your body. Tracking your mood over time can help you recognize patterns and pinpoint a cause, like if you always tend to feel depressed around the same time each month. If youâve been struggling with symptoms that may be related to changing hormones, tell your primary care doctor or your psychiatrist, who may refer you to an endocrinologist.  Feeling sad can weigh you down and make it tougher to enjoy your life, but itâs an important part of the human experience. Sadness can make you more empathetic toward others and yourself.  But no one deserves to feel sad all or most of the time. If youâre struggling with depressive symptoms, Talkiatry can help.

Health Shots connected with Dr Neha Dutt, counseling psychologist, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Delhi to find out about sadness and how to stop being sad. Dr Dutt says sadness is a response to something negative that may have happened whereas depression is a mental health condition and it’s more than just feeling sad. It can be a symptom of depression, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have depression. It’s important to recognise or identify and probe on feelings of your sadness and take steps to work on it. That’s needed because prolonged sadness can impact your activities of your daily life. As for depression, it is a clinical condition that typically involves a persistent and intense sadness or loss of interest in activities that you used to enjoy. Other symptoms of depression can include sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of suicide. You shouldn’t think about the things that are making you sad. Other ways to stop being sad are: It can be helpful to talk to someone about what’s been bothering you. This could be a friend or a family member. Talking about your feelings can help you gain perspective and find new ways to cope. They can even bring back the happiness in your life. Negative thoughts can contribute to feelings of sadness, says the expert. Try to identify and challenge negative thoughts when they pop up, and replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts. Be it writing, painting, or playing music, engaging in creative activities can be a therapeutic way to process your feelings and improve your mood. So, show your creative side. Taking care of yourself is an important part of managing sadness. This could involve things like getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising, and spending time doing things that you like doing. Mindfulness and deep breathing can be of great help. They will help you to stay in the present and focused in the moment, which can help to reduce feelings of sadness. Spending time in nature can have a calming affect and help to boost your mood. Even a short walk outside your house or office can make a difference. Select Topics of your interest and let us customize your feed. Set small goals and try to achieve them to help to boost your sense of accomplishment and improve your mood, says the expert. Gratitude should not be taken lightly. Focusing on the things that you are grateful for can help to shift your perspective and improve your mood. If your feelings of sadness continues or ends up interfering with your daily life, you should take help from a therapist or other mental health expert.

      "Before we get into hitting pause on your sads, we should discuss why it’s good to sit with those bummed out feelings when you can. “As the saying goes, ‘the only way out is through,’” says licensed clinical psychologist Ryan Howes, PhD. That means accepting that you feel sad is the first step in getting past whatever is getting you down. “For me…sometimes just saying, ‘I'm feeling sad because a sad thing happened, and I'm allowed to feel that way,’ [has helped],” says therapist Alo Johnston, LMFT. On top of that, trying to avoid feeling sad so you don’t have to deal, though normal, isn’t actually helpful, says Johnston. When you try to repress your sadness in the moment, it often bubbles up later when you don’t expect it, like in the produce aisle or something, he explains. If you can relate, you know that’s not exactly ideal, but it makes sense—those feelings are going to find a way to be expressed one way or another. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing since processing your emotions—even the not very pleasant ones—can teach you more about yourself, Dr. Howes says.   Δ All that said, sitting with your sadness can be exhausting, time consuming, and emotionally draining. You probably do  eventually need to go grocery shopping without crying in the produce aisle. So it’s completely reasonable to want (or need) to take a break from your sadness as it’s playing out—whether you need to pull it together to go to work or you just need to come up for air and a fresh perspective. So, how do you do that without slipping into a cycle of avoiding your feelings entirely? Here are a few expert-backed ways to take a break from being sad without ignoring or downplaying what you’re going through.  If you’ve ever stepped outside after spending a good chunk of time wallowing in your bedroom and finally felt like you could exhale, then you can probably relate to the power of a change of scenery. Spending time in a green space, if you have access to it, can be especially beneficial, says psychiatrist and psychotherapist Melissa Shepard, MD. Being in nature has even been shown to increase happiness and bring a sense of purpose to people’s lives, according to a review of research published in Science Advances. So go for a walk in a park, sit in said park, hike, bike, whatever. When you’re out and about in nature, your mind may start to drift—whether it’s back to your sad feels or something else. You might think about the meal prep you still have to do for the week or some backhanded comment a coworker gave you last Tuesday. But do your best to bring yourself to the present moment and focus on your surroundings to really ground yourself, suggests Dr. Shepard.   While it can be great to vent to people when you’re feeling all your feelings, it can also be helpful to use your support system for little breaks from your sadness, whether you’re turning to a therapist, family member, or friend. You might get a new perspective on your situation or just some much-needed validation that what you’re feeling is normal. One lesson that Dr. Shepard learned from her experience in medical school and residency was “never worry alone,” she recalls. “And I think that is good advice for any strong emotion. We are social creatures that are meant to rely on each other, and if you can share some of the burden, other people can help you carry it.” Fun fact: Controlling or stabilizing your emotions (in this case, sadness) with the help of another person is called co-regulation. Whoever your person is, they can actually serve as a source of stability that you can use to help you feel more grounded and present. At the same time, your brain works to mirror how that person is behaving. So talking it out with somebody who’s not outwardly deep in their blues may give you a sense of relief from your sadness. Treating yourself to things that feel physically good can help you care for yourself when you’re in a funk. That can include movement—literally any kind of movement—which therapist Jin Kim, LMFT, suggests big time. Take a 20-minute walk or put on some music and dance it out. Whatever works for you. FWIW, many studies have found a connection between happiness and physical activity.   Connecting with your joy offers a nice break when you’re stuck in sadness, says therapist and author Claire Bidwell Smith, LCPC. Even if you’d rather stay in your blanket burrito in bed, try to add in some elements of joy that you may have been denying yourself lately. That might look like watching a funny movie, listening to a podcast that makes you laugh, or settling into a cozy cave of ASMR on repeat. Leaning into joy may be hard for you, but you can always come back to your sadness whenever you’d like, Smith notes. Because sadness often tells us to isolate and withdraw, doing things that get you out of bed or even out of the house can help, says licensed clinical psychologist Sophia Choukas-Bradley, PhD, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. Doing activities that have the opposite vibe of how you’re currently feeling is actually a technique used in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) called opposite action.  Think of it like this: “Opposite action is not about trying to push away negative emotions. It’s about going towards how you wish to feel,” explains social worker and therapist Hayden Dawes, LCSW, LCAS. So try to take a shower, leave your house, dress up, see your friends, or do anything that gives you a sense of purpose. Not to get all philosophical on you, but a lot of therapists think of the human experience in three parts: our emotions, our behaviors, and our thoughts, says Dr. Howes. And when you’re feeling consumed by your emotions, like sadness, turning your attention to what you do or what you think can hit pause on all the things you’re feeling, he explains.  So, tackling an intellectual exercise like solving Wordle, planning your weekly schedule, reading an article or book, or writing a letter to a friend are all good moves here, says Dr. Howes. “Pulling yourself into a productive intellectual project can give you a break while also giving you a sense of accomplishment,” he explains.  Grab a journal, pull up the Notes app on your phone, or open a blank doc on your computer. Though it may not seem like a break, writing about your sadness can actually help you feel better, says therapist Lawrence Jackson, PhD, LMFT. Like talking about your sadness, journaling about it can serve as a release. “Externalizing your thoughts provides a bit more distance than just swimming in [your head],” Dawes further explains. That said, if you notice you feel worse after you write, try writing about your goals, happy memories, or good things that happened recently. And if you don’t know where to start, we’ve got a ton of journal prompts for you all geared toward the blues.     Wondermind does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

      "You may not particularly enjoy feeling sad. You may prefer experiencing other emotions. But if you try to avoid the emotion all together, mental health professionals want you to know not to. People tend to think that sadness is always bad, says Meaghan Barlow, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, who studies self-regulation, emotion, and aging. “That's absolutely not my view.” Distinct from depression — which the World Health Organization notes is a leading cause of disability worldwide — sadness is a common emotion. Dr. Barlow says that in the right context, sadness can even be helpful. A growing body of research supports her point of view. Here, Barlow and other experts explain what sadness is, how it impacts well-being, and how you can cope when it feels like too much. Sadness is “an emotional state of unhappiness, ranging in intensity from mild to extreme and usually aroused by the loss of something that is highly valued,” according to the American Psychological Association (APA). Both sadness and anger can feel unpleasant and distressing, and researchers sometimes lump the two together under the umbrella of “negative affect.” (This category also includes shame, guilt, anxiety, fear, and irritability, according to research.) But sadness and anger are distinct emotions with different purposes, as other research has outlined. Anger often occurs in response to a perceived injustice, according to the APA. So when you’re angry, you might have tunnel vision and feel motivated to deal with some kind of problem. “Anger is useful in overcoming resistance,” says Joseph Forgas, a doctor of science in psychology and Scientia Professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. For a long time, researchers didn’t know the purpose of sadness. But now researchers believe that sadness acts as a mild alert, says Dr. Forgas, who studies the emotion. Sadness tells you that you’re in an unfamiliar situation so you need to look out and be careful, he says. The emotion causes a slew of changes in thinking and behavior (more on that later), some of which Forgas detailed in a paper published in Current Directions in Psychological Science. Think about a time you’ve experienced a major rejection, says Ethan Kross, PhD, a professor of psychology and management and organizations at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who studies emotion and self-control. In the aftermath of the unexpected rejection, sadness might cause you to step back and try to better understand what implications that loss has for you. Withdrawing to reflect is a very different response from the quick action of anger, says Dr. Kross. According to the APA, persistent sadness is one of the two defining symptoms of a major depressive episode. But to experience sadness is not the same as having depression. In nondepressed individuals, sadness comes and goes. But when sadness is experienced intensely and for a long time, and is accompanied by other hallmark depression symptoms (lack of interest or pleasure in most activities, fatigue, and changes in appetite), it may indicate the presence of a depressive disorder. “It’s really about the degree and duration,” says Kross. Depression, in contrast to sadness, tends to be debilitating, making it difficult to perform everyday tasks, according to the APA (PDF). “It is a very serious disease that has very serious consequences,” says Forgas. That differs from everyday sad moods, which occur all the time to all of us. It can be tough to tell whether you’re experiencing everyday sadness or depression. Depression doesn’t look the same in everyone, which can make it difficult to recognize sometimes, Kross notes. However, if you experience symptoms including fatigue, changes in your appetite, withdrawing from friends, feeling low energy, and the inability to feel happy over a two-week period to the extent that they’re interfering with day-to-day functioning, consider talking to your doctor about getting screened for a mood disorder. Sadness is ultimately caused by the loss of something important. The sense of loss has an element of emotional time travel, according to Steven C. Hayes, PhD, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Nevada in Reno, who has developed therapeutic strategies that incorporate mindfulness and acceptance. That means that when you experience sadness, Dr. Hayes says, you may be looking backward in time to something you once had or projecting forward and anticipating that your expectations won’t be met. For instance, you may feel sad about recent political upheaval because you hold an expectation for a future world that is more cooperative and kind, and that is threatened by current events. This example highlights an important feature of a sadness-inducing loss: It touches on something you deeply care about. You can recognize sadness in yourself and others through its telltale characteristics. According to a review published in 2020 in Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, the following can be signs of sadness: People who are sad might say they feel lonely, distressed, depressed, anxious, or grief. Researchers who study sadness, including Forgas, acknowledge that the word “sadness” has multiple meanings. These meanings may map on to different experiences. For example, a  study published in 2017 in Frontiers in Psychology compared sadness caused by imagining the death of a loved one and sadness caused by imagining failing to reach a goal. Even though participants in both groups felt sad, the two types of sadness were associated with distinct physical and psychological responses. It can be a useful exercise to find your own description for what sadness is like for you, says Deb Dana, LCSW, a clinician and consultant specializing in complex trauma and author of Anchored: How to Befriend Your Nervous System Using Polyvagal Theory. Dana suggests comparing and contrasting your experience of sadness with how its opposite, happiness, feels. For example, for her, happiness includes moving through the world with lightness, while sadness comes with a heavy feeling in her body. These extremes can help you notice more subtle versions of the feelings. “It’s easier to tap into when they’re so far apart,” she says. The main message coming from a very large number of experiments, including his own lab, says Forgas, is that many positive benefits come from mild, temporary sad moods. Forgas authored a review on the topic, which was published in the journal Australian Psychologist. Sadness, like all emotions, serves an important function by helping us respond to our circumstances in ways that set us up to take better care of our emotional health and well-being. As Kross notes, when we feel sad, we step back, reflect, and return more prepared to deal with what’s in front of us. And sadness may not have as many negative implications for health as other distressing emotions. Research suggests that inflammation and negative affect are linked. Increased inflammation is concerning, says Barlow, because of downstream negative consequences for physical health. But when you look at just sadness, it may not actually affect the body in this way. Research from Barlow’s team, published in 2019 in Psychology and Aging, links self-reported anger with increased inflammation and chronic illness, but not self-reported sadness. Here are some of the specific benefits that have been linked to sadness, and when sadness itself can be unhealthy. In familiar situations, we all rely on mental shortcuts and intuition to get by. When you feel sad, these automatic tendencies are reduced. Forgas says that when you’re sad, it’s almost as if you pay more attention to what’s in front of you. This approach helps you think more clearly in different ways, many of which Forgas has studied over the decades. His lab conducted research showing that people had better eyewitness memory when in a slightly worse mood. Another study demonstrated that on what Forgas calls “sad mood days,” people had improved recall and attention to the environment. More recently, in a paper published in 2019 in Current Directions in Psychological Science, he described a series of studies that together make the case that a sad mood makes people less gullible. All of this happens without your noticing it. By the time you recognize that you’re sad, sadness tends to go away, Forgas says. The takeaway, he says, isn’t that you should try to make yourself sad on purpose to think more clearly; it’s that when you happen to be sad, you can take solace that it may be helping you accurately process what’s going on so you can proceed in healthy ways. You might think you should wait to have a conversation until you’re in a good mood. But Forgas has conducted research that demonstrates that people in a negative mood appear to communicate better than those in a positive one. “They understand ambiguities in sentences better. They're better at persuading other people,” he says. Forgas says that these effects work automatically, not consciously, so the idea isn’t to try to become sad on purpose before a tough conversation. Rather, don’t put off a difficult conversation because it makes you sad; you may be able to better state how you feel in the depths of the emotion. One of the primary functions of sadness is to signal the need for social support, says Barlow. Consider two people: one who is sad and one who is angry. When you see someone who is sad, you have an innate urge to assist them. When you see someone who is angry, you automatically pull away. Researchers have published findings that demonstrate this gut reaction isn’t just you. One study looked at sad facial expressions and another study examined tears, and both found that those signs of sadness appear to signal to others that we could use their help. Sadness appears to improve certain interpersonal skills as well. A study that Forgas was part of showed that people in a negative mood tend to be more fair toward others, while other research showed that they are more polite. One of the key functions of sadness is helping you accept tough situations and come to terms with loss, says Barlow. While facilitating disengagement isn’t always good, it can sometimes be necessary. “Sometimes there are things beyond your control that it's actually adaptive to let go of,” Barlow says. These occasions tend to happen more often as you age, Barlow explains. The onset of chronic illness, for example, often requires that you let go of the goal of trying to reverse or cure something, and instead accept your diagnosis and try to manage whatever it is you’re dealing with, she says. Sadness helps with this by causing changes in thinking and behavior that help people adapt to loss and move forward based on a new circumstances — research (PDF) backs this up). In other words, sadness promotes coping, Forgas says. Other research published in 2021 shows that sadness increases healthy intentions, such as quitting smoking or increasing exercise. People who are sad may feel empowered to make these healthy changes because emotions cause us to see the world in certain ways. Sadness, which is associated with the sense that someone or something is responsible for what has happened, appears to increase people’s belief that circumstances are controllable. Despite all of these potential benefits associated with sadness, when the emotion is experienced too intensely or for too long, it can indeed be bad for your health, says Kross. When sadness persists and is accompanied by other symptoms, it’s considered depression, a clinically diagnosed mood disorder. Research has linked depression to a host of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, according to a review in the European Heart Journal, and death from cancer, per a systematic review in Molecular Psychiatry. Barlow says that whether sadness is bad for your health is all about the context. Ideally, momentary experiences of sadness trigger its adaptive functions, then the sad feelings go away. But, she says, when sadness is consuming in a way that interferes with different aspects of your life, the feeling no longer serves its proper function. A healthy response to sadness begins with allowing yourself to feel sadness when it comes, says Hayes. He says that habits like meditation and prayer can help you notice your sadness without judging it. In time, these mindfulness practices let you stay present with the sometimes painful feeling. But feeling sadness doesn’t mean you need to spend hours alone wallowing or feeling bad, says Hayes. Instead, according to Kross, a healthy response to sadness includes the capacity to dial down how strong the feeling is and shorten how long it lasts. Kross has put together a list of science-backed tools (PDF) that he says can help you do this. One option is to spend time in nature, which can have a calming effect, according to a research review published in Behavioral Sciences. Kross says that using these skills lets you benefit from sadness without experiencing the problems that come when the feeling is too intense or persists for too long. One benefit of sadness comes when we learn from it, says Hayes. It can be helpful to see emotions as gentle guides, not dictators, that provide “one of several sources of information about our present moment,” he says. When you take time to reflect on this information, you can, hopefully, learn something that allows you to move on, adds Kross. But it’s also true that the chronic experience of sadness is a valid reason to seek support, Barlow adds. If your sadness interferes with living the life you want for more than two weeks, or if your coping tools aren’t helping, that’s a cue to get professional help, says Kross. And if you’re ever not sure how severe it is, err on the side of taking your sadness seriously, says Barlow. Instead of going it alone, tell a person you trust about what’s been going on. Someone like your primary care provider can help you decide if you need further care and what to do next.

      "I was curled up in my bed, in the fetal position, my thoughts deep in the darkness. Everything about my life felt sad and empty. I was lost in the depth of it all. All I wanted in life was to learn how to stop feeling sad and empty.  Life felt so sad that I contemplated ending my life at the time; the emptiness was deafening. All I was feeling empty feelings. I did my best to fulfill my responsibilities while doing just enough to make it through the day. On top of that, I found myself feeling lonely feelings in all emptiness. The sadness and emptiness were gray clouds that would open up with pour over me at any given moment. If you’ve been feeling sad and empty, I’m sure you relate. And you may be seeking ways to stop feeling empty all the time. Sometimes it can feel like such a deep hole that seemingly has no escape.  But I assure you there are ways to deal with feeling empty and sad so often. I found my way out of the sadness and emptiness and towards sustainable happiness. And now, as a Happiness and Manifestation Coach and Educator, I give everything I know away. In this article, we will discuss why we might feel sad and empty, how we know that we have these feelings, and how to stop feeling sad and empty.      Emptiness is associated with mental health issues like narcissism, schizophrenia, and depression. However, even those who have never struggled with mental health might sometimes feel empty. Feeling emptiness is a poorly understood state in psychology, with complex emotions experienced differently by different people. It’s a feeling where you often feel alone and socially disconnected, unfilled in your personal life, and that life has no meaning.   Some reasons why you might feel sad and empty are: A traumatic experience can make you feel empty, insecure and lose your sense of self. And this can cause long-term distress. To cope with these feelings, your body may make you physically feel empty to protect itself. In a way emotionally numb protects you from the pain of the traumatic experience.   When you face difficult times, you may sometimes feel numb or disconnected as a way to manage. It often happens without you being aware of it. And while this can help you temporarily, relying on this too much can lead to a lasting feeling of emptiness.   If you’re experiencing burnout, you may feel completely drained and disengaged from the things that used to bring you joy. Burnout is not just about work, this can happen in any aspect of your life, from your career to your personal relationships or responsibilities, and can leave you feeling defeated and unfulfilled.   When you lack the tools to handle complex emotions, it’s tempting to shut them off and become indifferent. I’ve done this myself and know others who have as well, since processing the emotions was much harder then turning them off.  For many shutting down is a form of survival. But avoiding these feelings can make you feel empty.   When you feel physically, emotionally, or energetically drained, it can leave you feeling empty. It’s a crash and burn pathway.  Not getting enough sleep during this time can make your feelings of emptiness even more significant and harder to manage.   Lacking happiness can cause you to have a sense of emptiness and often, it’s tempting to also start to neglect your well-being. It’s a vicious cycle that causes the unhappiness and in result the feelings of emptiness.   If your reasons aren’t listed here, remember that feeling empty can be experienced for various reasons. So, it’s important to remember that everyone’s experience is unique and valid, including yours.    \n",

      " The feeling of emptiness often comes with other unpleasant emotions and experiences like sadness, frustration, overburden, lack of interest, indifference, and numbness. Unlike the heaviness that can be felt in depression and sadness, with emptiness, you feel void of emotions. However, each person’s experience with emptiness is one of a kind.  There are different ways in which this emotion can manifest, such as postcoital dysphoria, which is a feeling of sadness after sexual intercourse or a sense of emptiness after crying. The latter occurs because crying requires a lot of energy and can leave a person feeling drained. Continue reading, as you will learn how to overcome sadness and emptiness.   It might take time, but as you do these steps, you will start to feel better. Always remember that you don’t have to do it all, just start with what you can, even if it’s one thing.   To overcome feelings of emptiness and despair, you must acknowledge and accept them. Don’t ignore or suppress you emotions, but recognize their presence. This is a necessary step towards healing. Emotions can live in our bodies and cause even more damage to our well-being. Find ways to release the emotions and to process through them so that you can begin moving forward towards happiness.   To effectively manage feelings of emptiness, it is so important to gain a deep understanding of your emotions and the root causes behind them.  You can proactively anticipate and manage these emotions by identifying triggers and patterns.  There are many techniques on how to do this, but using techniques from emotion-focused therapy, or EFT, can help you develop emotional awareness and take control of your emotional well-being.    You can enhance your emotional regulation skills to manage overwhelming sadness or emptiness.  One way you can do this is by practicing deep breathing techniques, systematically relaxing your muscles, and engaging in grounding exercises.  Make sure to inhale deeply and exhale slowly to aid in calming your mind and body.  Try methodically tensing and releasing your muscles to alleviate built-up tension in your body.  Lastly, practice grounding exercises to direct your attention to the present moment and restore a sense of tranquility.   A typical method used in therapy to relieve feelings of emptiness and sadness is called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).  CBT allows you to recognize unhelpful thinking patterns and beliefs, which allows you to confront those thought patterns and ideas and replace them with healthier, more positive thoughts. To use CBT you’ll work with a therapist, which can be found either online or locally in your area.   Maintaining a regular schedule can give you a feeling of control and predictability, which can help reduce feelings of emptiness.  A daily routine provides structure, enables you to manage your time effectively, and ensures you have time for self-care. Your routine can be as simple as you’d like, however it is the consistency of repeating it each day that will help regulate your inner wellness.   If you’re feeling empty or grieving, engaging in social activities could help alleviate those feelings.  While you may not want to do so initially, building meaningful relationships with others can provide emotional support and decrease feelings of isolation. Even if this means calling one friend and having coffee with them, do this at least once this week as you begin opening yourself to engaging socially, despite the sadness and emptiness.   You can gain a sense of purpose and direction by setting a few goals for yourself.  Choose small goals that you know you can confidently accomplish.  Start with tiny goals. The accumulation of the good feeling hormones you will receive by accomplishing your small goals will boost confidence and self-esteem.  And in turn, doing these goals can assist in the fight against feelings of emptiness.   To feel better, try being kind to yourself and others.  You can generate positive emotions by practicing compassion. You can also cultivate these qualities by helping others.  Simple acts of kindness, like volunteering or helping a neighbor, can bring a sense of fulfillment to your life.   Make a list of the things, activities, and people that bring you comfort in life.  During the week choose or two things from your list and experience them. For example, if nature is in your list, then you might choose to take a walk around your local park. Or if you have special desserts on your list, you can visit a local bakery to have your favorite dessert.   Remember that seeking treatment from a mental health professional is essential if you are experiencing feelings of emptiness or melancholy that do not go away.  These techniques are not meant to replace assistance from a trained expert. They can be used in conjunction with psychotherapy and other forms of treatment. Feeling sad is a normal part of being human. It can happen for many reasons, like losing someone important, adjusting to a new place, or feeling disappointed.  However, if your sadness overwhelms your ability to live or enjoy things, then it is time to seek help.  Here are some ways that might be useful to do in order to stop feeling sad:   Connecting with sympathetic and helpful people is essential.  Talk to them about how you’re feeling. This could be a dependable friend, a family member, or a professional in the mental health field.  Expressing your emotions and putting things into perspective can be incredibly therapeutic.   Studies have shown that regular exercise can help lessen feelings of sadness by improving mood and functioning as a natural stress reliever.  You should participate in an activity you enjoy, such as walking, riding a bike, doing yoga, or even dancing.   Maintaining good health for the body and mind relies heavily on our food.  Try to get a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. What goes into your body can affect your emotions, so be mindful of what you choose.    Being mindful is paying attention to the here and now without judging what you see.  By doing so, you can better accept your feelings of melancholy without trying to avoid or alter them.  I often use mindfulness as a helpful technique for managing stress and increasing my ability to feel ground and calm.    Practice good self-care by giving yourself time to relax and unwind.  Your self-care can be anything as simple as having a hot bath, reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or doing anything that makes you happy and relaxes you.   Keeping a journal in which you write about your feelings gives you an outlet for dumping all your thoughts on paper and processing them through writing. Be sure to not judge or edit yourself as you write, this is your safe and personal space to be, through your writing.    If you find that your emotions of sadness are persistent or have a substantial impact on your ability to function, consult a mental health expert such as a psychologist or psychiatrist for assistance.  They can offer a correct diagnosis and a treatment plan, which may involve the use of therapy or medication.   You might sometimes hear people say they feel “empty.” That’s not a primary emotion like being happy, sad, scared, angry, surprised, or disgusted.  When you feel empty, you might feel like there’s nothing inside you. You might also feel numb, as if you’re not feeling anything.  Sometimes, you might even feel like you’re not connected to yourself or the people around you. Even though feeling empty isn’t a basic emotion, it’s a real thing that people feel.  Feeling empty and sad often keeps you stuck in life, but there are ways out. Follow the tips in this article, seek support, and you will overcome. You will become happier. Contact Me  Copyright © 2024 Giselle Baumet  Disclaimer   \n"

      "Becoming Minimalist Own less. Live more. Finding minimalism in a world of consumerism. Written by guest · 39 Comments  Note: This is a guest post from Jay Harrington of Life and Whim.  After a long, brutal winter, it feels great to be outside again in a t-shirt, even if the temperatures aren’t climbing much beyond fifty degrees here in northern Michigan. In our community, which was recently buried in snow, people are out in force, combing beaches for rocks, riding bikes, hiking trails, cruising on paddleboards, and celebrating spring’s arrival. In addition to short sleeves, lots of people are wearing beaming smiles on their faces. Happiness is in the air. This is true despite the fact that the weather hasn’t even been that great—it just seems great relative to what we’re used to. Come fall, however, after a long, hot summer, we will start longing for cool, crisp air, and even (for some of us) the first snowflakes flying which will signal the coming ski season. The cycle of expectations and adaptation will then repeat. As humans, we are always chasing rainbows. We want something—be it different weather, a better job, or a bigger house—but shortly after getting it, we want something different. We adapt to our circumstances, they become the “new normal,” and we want more. We want a happier life. This phenomenon is called “hedonic adaptation.” It’s a term coined by psychologists Brickman and Campbell in the 1970s to explain our tendency as human beings to chase a happier life, only to return back to our original emotional baseline after getting what we want. We run on a hedonic treadmill, and get nowhere, despite exerting massive effort along the way. A belief that “bigger and better” leads to a happier life results, paradoxically, in less of it. We work really hard because we want more. We obtain more, and the shine soon wears off. So we work harder, in pursuit of even more, and become less happy as a result. The beat goes on. It’s clear from the science that the acquisition of bigger and better things doesn’t result in a happy life. So what will? In his book Happier, Harvard lecturer Tal Ben-Shahar defines the “arrival fallacy,” which is a corollary to the concept of hedonic adaptation. He describes the arrival fallacy as: “The false belief that reaching a valued destination can sustain happiness.” I’ve certainly fallen victim to the arrival fallacy, having felt at first elated, then almost immediately letdown, following job promotions, raises, and new car or home purchases. I wanted these things so badly, but the reality of obtaining them was far different than my expectations. In an interesting study from the 1970s, researchers studied the happiness levels of two different groups of people: lottery winners and accident victims. The surprising result of the study was that, once the initial elation of winning the lottery and shock of the accident wore off, both groups returned to their original levels of happiness. Over the long-term, these drastically different external events—one seemingly positive and the other negative—had no appreciable impact on happiness. If winning the lottery won’t make us happier, what will? Ben-Shahar suggests that it is not reaching a particular destination (metaphorically speaking) that makes us happy, but rather learning to appreciate the journey toward the destination: Attaining lasting happiness requires that we enjoy the journey on our way toward a destination we deem valuable. Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain; happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak. In this sense, ambition, itself, is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s a very good thing. If humans did not want for more then we’d still be living in caves, without access to basic, modern human necessities such as electricity and clean water, nor marvels of human ingenuity such as modern medicine, art, and technology. Problems arise when we allow the unending pursuit of growth and acquisition to inhibit our pursuit of happiness. Both ambitions—happiness and growth—can coexist, but only in balance. Growth can crowd out a happy life if you’re not careful. One of the most important and growing costs of the modern way of life is ‘cultural fraud’: the promotion of images and ideals of ‘the good life’ that serve the economy but do not meet psychological needs, nor reflect social realities. —Richard Eckersley I would, of course, never presume to suggest that I know what makes you, or anyone else, happy. We all have distinct visions, preferences, and desires for our lives. But years of scientific research suggests that certain things make most of us happy. In particular, happiness is not derived from attaining outward signals of success (bigger and better in order to “keep up with the Joneses”), but rather seeking satisfaction from new and novel experiences in pursuit of a life well-lived. What types of experiences pay the biggest happiness dividends? I recently attended a conference in New Orleans and the keynote speaker was the University of Amherst professor, Catherine A. Sanderson, author of Science of Happiness. She is known as “The Happiness Professor.” Sanderson explained that there are 10 ways to increase your everyday happiness, according to decades worth of scientific research: 1. Make little changes in your daily routine, such as getting more sleep, exercising, getting out into nature, and meditating. 2. Read more books. Read books to learn—research suggests that lifelong learners remain healthy and engaged, and live long lives. Read books as an escape from your everyday life, Read books—it will make you happy. 3. Find your right fit or match, both personally and professionally. If you love what you do and who you are with, you’ll position yourself for personal happiness and professional success. 4. Be grateful. Sanderson suggested two specific activities to help foster a greater sense of gratitude. First, keep a daily gratitude journal. Second, pay a “gratitude visit” to someone from your past who has had a significant impact on your life, and let them know how you feel. 5. Smile more—even if you don’t feel like it. Research shows that the simple act of smiling can trick your brain into a happier state. 6. Relish simple, everyday moments. Appreciating life’s small moments, such as a beautiful, sunny day, green shoots sprouting from the ground, and skipping rocks at the beach, teaches you to be more grateful for what you have, especially during moments of stress and angst. 7. Perform random acts of kindness. Do good deeds. Volunteer. Be charitable. Shop (for someone else!). Numerous studies have shown that you can help yourself by doing good for others. 8. Spend money on experiences versus things. Studies have shown that buying an object—a car, handbag, or kitchen gadget—can quickly lead to buyer’s remorse. On the other hand, investing in experiences—a concert, a camping trip, music lessons—leads to greater happiness. Experiences create “happiness residue,” and our perceptions of them often get better over time. 9. Avoid comparisons. Whatever you may think of someone else’s life, particularly as viewed through the phony, filtered lens of social media, it’s almost certainly messier than you imagine. It’s easier to embrace, and learn to love, your own imperfections, if you don’t conjure up myths about how perfect everyone else’s lives seem. 10. Build and maintain close relationships. According to Sanderson, having a small number of tight, meaningful relationships is one of the highest predictors of happiness. Don’t feel bad if you lose sight of some of these happiness priorities—we all do. We have to battle relentless marketing and societal expectations that suggest that the path to happiness lies elsewhere. People are exposed to many messages that encourage them to believe that a change of weight, scent, hair color (or coverage), car, clothes, or many other aspects will produce a marked improvement in their happiness. Our research suggests a moral, and a warning: Nothing that you focus on will make as much difference as you think. —Daniel Kahneman Don’t over-complicate your pursuit of happiness. As the research suggests, it’s the simple things that matter most for a happy life. Make happiness a habit that is within your control, rather than seeking it from external sources. Life is nothing but a series of moments, both big and small, and the key to living a happy life lies is living each one with purpose and intention. *** Jay Harrington is a “reformed lawyer” turned author and entrepreneur, and blogs at Life and Whim where he helps people find purpose and live big through small moments.

      "Regardless of your version of true happiness, living a happier, more satisfied life is within reach. A few tweaks to your regular habits like getting more sleep and exercise can help you get there. Habits matter. If you’ve ever tried breaking a bad habit, you know all too well how engrained they are. Well, good habits are deeply engrained, too. Why not work on making positive habits part of your routine? Below, you’ll find suggestions for daily, monthly, and yearly habits to help kickstart your quest. Just remember that everyone’s version of happiness is a little different, and so is their path to achieving it. If some of these habits create added stress or just don’t fit your lifestyle, ditch them. With a little time and practice, you’ll figure out what does and doesn’t work for you. The following daily habits may help you achieve more happiness in your life. You tend to smile when you’re happy. But it’s actually a two-way street. We smile because we’re happy, and smiling causes the brain to release dopamine, which makes us happier. While not completely foolproof, researchers have found that the link between smiling and happiness could be attributed to the “facial feedback hypothesis,” where facial expressions may have a modest influence on emotions.  That does not mean you have to go around with a fake smile plastered on your face all the time. But the next time you find yourself feeling low, crack a smile and see what happens. Or try starting each morning by smiling at yourself in the mirror. Exercise isn’t just for your body. Regular exercise can help reduce stress, feelings of anxiety, and symptoms of depression while boosting self-esteem and happiness. Even a small amount of physical activity can make a difference. You don’t have to train for a triathlon or scale a cliff — unless that’s what makes you happy, of course. The trick is to not overexert yourself. If you suddenly throw yourself into a strenuous routine, you may just end up frustrated (and sore). Consider these exercise starters: Remind yourself of any fun activities you once enjoyed but that have fallen by the wayside. Or you could consider starting activities you always wanted to try, such as golf, bowling, or dancing. Most adults need at least 7 hours of sleep every night. If you find yourself fighting the urge to nap during the day or just generally feel like you’re in a fog, your body may be telling you it needs more rest. No matter how much our modern society steers us toward less sleep, we know that adequate sleep is vital to good health, brain function, and emotional well-being. Getting enough sleep also reduces your risk of developing certain chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, depression, and diabetes. Here are a few tips to help you build a better sleep routine: If you consistently have problems sleeping, consider talking with a doctor. You may have a sleep disorder that requires treatment. You may already know that your food choices have an impact on your overall physical health. But some foods can also affect your state of mind. For example: If you want to eat with your mood in mind, consider starting with making one food choice for your mood each day. For example, swap a big, sweet breakfast pastry for some Greek yogurt with fruit. You’ll still satisfy your sweet tooth, and the protein will help you avoid a midmorning energy crash. Consider adding in a new food swap each week. Simply being grateful can give your mood a big boost, among other benefits. For example, a two-part study found that practicing gratitude can have a significant impact on feelings of hope and happiness. You might try starting each day by acknowledging one thing you’re grateful for. You can do this while you’re brushing your teeth or just waiting for that snoozed alarm to go off. As you go about your day, consider keeping an eye out for pleasant things in your life. They can be big things, such as knowing that someone loves you or getting a well-deserved promotion. But they can also be little things, such as a co-worker who offered you a cup of coffee or the neighbor who waved to you. Maybe it could even just be the warmth of the sun on your skin. With a little practice, you may even become more aware of all the positive things around you. Research shows that performing acts of kindness may also help promote your overall well-being.  Giving a sincere compliment is a quick, easy way to brighten someone’s day while giving your own happiness a boost. Catch the person’s eye and say it with a smile so they know you mean it. You might be surprised by how good it makes you feel. If you want to offer someone a compliment on their physical appearance, make sure to do it in a respectful way. You’re tense, your shoulders are tight, and you feel as though you just might “lose it.” We all know that feeling. Instinct may tell you to take a long, deep breath to calm yourself down. Turns out, that instinct is a good one. Research supports the fact that slow breathing and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress. The next time you feel stressed or are at your wit’s end, work through these steps: If you’re having a hard time taking slow, deliberate breaths, try counting to 5 in your head with each inhale and exhale. A positive attitude is generally a good thing, but bad things happen to everyone. It’s just part of life. If you get some bad news, make a mistake, or just feel like you’re in a funk, don’t try to pretend you’re happy. Acknowledge the feeling of unhappiness, letting yourself experience it for a moment. Then shift your focus toward what made you feel this way and what it might take to recover. Would a deep breathing exercise help? A long walk outside? Talking it over with someone? Let the moment pass and take care of yourself. Remember, no one’s happy all the time. A journal is a good way to organize your thoughts, analyze your feelings, and make plans. And you don’t have to be a literary genius or write volumes to benefit. It can be as simple as jotting down a few thoughts before you go to bed. If putting certain things in writing makes you nervous, you can always shred it when you’ve finished. It’s the process that counts. Not sure what to do with all the feelings that end up on the page? Our guide to organizing your feelings may help. Life is full of stressors, and it’s impossible to avoid all of them. There’s no need to. Stress isn’t always harmful, and we can even change our attitudes about stress. Sometimes, there’s an upside to stress. For those stressors you can’t avoid, remind yourself that everyone has stress — there’s no reason to think it’s all on you. And chances are, you’re stronger than you might think you are. Instead of letting yourself get overwhelmed, try to address the stressor head-on. This might mean initiating an uncomfortable conversation or putting in some extra work, but the sooner you confront it, the sooner the pit in your stomach may start to shrink. Whether it happens on social media, at work, or even at a yoga class, it’s easy to fall into a place where you’re comparing yourself to others. The result? You may experience more discontent, lower self-esteem, and even depression and anxiety. It can take practice to stop comparing yourself to others, but it’s worth it for the benefit of having your inner peace and happiness.  You can start with some of the other tips on this list that can help draw your attention inward to yourself, such as deep breathing and journaling. You may also consider talking with a therapist for perspective. The following tips include weekly habits that may help you feel happier. Decluttering sounds like a big project, but setting aside just 20 minutes a week can have a big impact. What can you do in 20 minutes? Lots. Set a timer on your phone and take 15 minutes to tidy up a specific area of one room — say, your closet or that out-of-control junk drawer. Put everything in its place and toss or give away any extra clutter that’s not serving you anymore. Keep a designated box for giveaways to make things a little easier (and avoid creating more clutter). Use the remaining 5 minutes to do a quick walk through your living space, putting away whatever stray items end up in your path. You can do this trick once a week, once a day, or anytime you feel like your space is getting out of control. Humans are largely considered social beings, and while the research is mixed on how exactly socialization impacts happiness, the consensus is that having social relationships can make us happy. Who do you miss? Reach out to them. Make a date to get together or simply have a long phone chat. In adulthood, it can feel next to impossible to make new friends. But it’s not about how many friends you have. It’s about having meaningful relationships — even if it’s just with one or two people. Try getting involved in a local volunteer group or taking a class. Both can help connect you with like-minded people in your area. And it’s likely they’re looking for friends, too. Companionship doesn’t have to be limited to other humans. Pets can offer similar benefits, according to multiple studies. Love animals but can’t have a pet? Consider volunteering at a local animal shelter to make some new friends — both human and animal. Feel like you’re flailing about? Try sitting down at the end of every week and making a basic list for the following week. Even if you don’t stick to the plan, blocking out time where you can do laundry, go grocery shopping, or tackle projects at work can help quiet your mind. You can get a fancy planner or app, but even a sticky note on your computer or piece of scrap paper in your pocket can do the job. Unplug. Really. There’s mounting evidence to support the fact that excessive phone use can lead to changes in the brain and impact your mood, with one review even revealing more serious cognitive and emotional changes in adolescents and young adults.  Turn off all the electronics and put those earbuds away for at least 1 hour once a week. They’ll still be there for you later if you want them. If you haven’t unplugged in a while, you might be surprised at the difference it makes. Let your mind wander free for a change. Read. Meditate. Take a walk and pay attention to your surroundings. Be sociable. Or be alone. Just be. Sound too daunting? Try unplugging for a shorter amount of time several times a week. Spending 30 minutes or more a week in green spaces can help lower blood pressure and the chances of developing depression, according to one study.  Your green space could be anything such as your neighborhood park, your own backyard, or a rooftop garden — anywhere you can appreciate and enjoy nature and fresh air. Better yet, add some outdoor exercise into the mix for extra benefit. The same aforementioned study found that people who spent time in green spaces were also more likely to exercise more frequently and for longer each time. There are many methods of meditation to explore. They can involve movement, focus, spirituality, or a combination of all three. Meditation doesn’t have to be complicated. It can be as simple as sitting quietly with your own thoughts for 5 minutes. Even the deep breathing exercises mentioned earlier can serve as a form of meditation. We’re certainly happier when we learn how to cope with obstacles. When you’re faced with a problem, think about what got you through something similar in the past. Would it work here? What else can you try? If you feel like you’re hitting a brick wall, consider speaking with a mental health professional like a therapist on a weekly basis. You don’t need to have a diagnosed mental health condition or overwhelming crisis to seek therapy. Mental health professionals are trained to help people improve coping skills. Plus, there’s no obligation to continue once you start. Even just a few sessions can help you add some new goodies to your emotional toolbox. Worried about the cost? It’s possible to afford therapy on any budget. It’s easy to neglect self-care in a fast-paced world. But trying to find time to nurture yourself as much as you can is important in supporting your body’s responsibilities of carrying your thoughts, passions, and spirit through this world. Maybe it’s unwinding your workweek with a long, hot bath. Or it may be adopting a skin care routine that makes you feel indulgent. Or it could be simply setting aside a night to put on your softest jammies and watch a movie from start to finish. Whatever it is, make time for it. Put it in your planner if you must, but try to make it a priority do it. You might want to give these monthly habits to improve your happiness a try. If you find that giving daily compliments provides a needed boost to your mood, consider making a monthly routine of giving back on a larger scale. Maybe that’s helping out at a food bank on the third weekend of every month or offering to watch your friend’s kids one night per month. No one to go out with? Well, what rule says you can’t go out alone? Consider going to your favorite restaurant, taking in a movie, or going on that trip you’ve always dreamed of. Even if you’re a social butterfly, spending some deliberate time alone can help you reconnect with the activities that truly make you happy. You arrive for an appointment with 10 minutes to spare. What do you do with that time? Pick up your cell phone to scroll through social media? Worry about the busy week you have ahead of you? Trying to take control of your thoughts during these brief windows of time can offer benefits. At the start of each month, make a short list of happy memories or things you’re looking forward to on a small piece of paper or on your phone. When you find yourself waiting for a ride, standing in line at the grocery store, or just with a few minutes to kill, break out the list. You can even use it when you’re just generally feeling down and need to change up your thoughts. Try following habits once a year or more to reflect and plan for happiness. While the start of a new year is a good time to stop and take inventory of your life, you can set up yearly habits at any point in the year. Try setting aside some time to catch up with yourself the way you would with an old friend: But try to avoid judging yourself too harshly for your answers. You’ve made it to another year, and that’s a reason to celebrate. If you find that your mood hasn’t improved much over the last year, consider talking with a doctor or mental health professional. You might be dealing with depression or even an underlying physical condition that’s affecting your mood. People change, so try thinking about where you’re heading and consider if that’s still where you want to go. There’s no shame in changing your plans. Let go of any goals that no longer serve you, even if they sound nice on paper. You’ve likely heard this before, including several times in this article. Your physical and mental health are closely intertwined. As you build habits to improve your happiness, it’s important to follow up with routine appointments to help take care your body, such as: This can often be easier said than done. But remembering that you are not necessarily doing it for another person or other people may help you be more open to beginning the process. Sometimes, offering forgiveness or dropping a grudge is more about self-care than compassion for others. Take stock of your relationships with others. Are you harboring any resentment or ill will toward someone? If so, consider reaching out to them in an effort to bury the hatchet. This does not have to be a reconciliation. You may just need to end the relationship and move on. If reaching out is not an option, try getting your feelings out in a letter. You don’t even have to send it to them. Just getting your feelings out of your mind and into the world can be freeing. You can even shred the letter afterward if you want to. With an ever-hectic schedule, sometimes it’s easy to forget to schedule something else that’s crucial to your well-being: time off. You can reap even more benefits by planning a trip, whether it’s close to home or somewhere further away. What’s more, research also backs both the mental and physical benefits of taking that much-needed vacation. In one such study, researchers looked at stress and heart rate as it relates to taking a vacation.

      "When you make an intentional choice every day to worry less, you will live a happier, more fulfilling life. The impact of your own lives trickles down onto those surrounding you too. Don't get caught up so much with life that you forget to enjoy the things that truly matter. If you would do one thing without receiving a paycheck for the rest of your life, what would it be? Question yourself on why your goals are so important. This exercise helps you determine if you are on a quest after your purpose. One step to finding your purpose is to look within yourself and identify your talents and passion. Find something that the world is in need of such more passionate medical professionals. Align your strengths with the need and see how you can be a problem solver while making a meaningful difference doing it. Time is the currency of life; you are only allowed to enjoy it for a limited period. It’s easy to get caught up worrying about the future that you forget to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. We’ve all been there. You’re travelling on a train but you are deep in thought. Your mind is constantly wandering and contemplating the things you need to get done. Worrying about the unknown will only make you anxious. Training your mind to be present helps you appreciate the time you presently have and enjoy every moment of it. Human beings are highly social creatures that thrive from other human beings' company. Surrounding yourself with those you genuinely care for can have numerous benefits for you as a person. Social connections can help you cope with anxiety and sadness, enable you to be more emotionally intelligent, increase self-esteem and empathy, and even boost your immune systems. Dedicating time to make meaningful connections can have many understated benefits that can be great for overall fulfillment in life.  According to research, the average person has roughly 150 uncompleted tasks that they think about daily. These files are like open tabs on your computer, they not only slow down your Operating System, but also distract you from being productive. The more open files you have the less you get done. Instead of multitasking, setting a schedule to get your work done and organizing the tasks in order of priority not only increases productivity, but also helps you get your life in order, leading to a more fulfilled life. Physical activity is not only necessary to stay fit, but it's also a great way to cope with stress. When you work out, your body reacts by releasing chemicals that make you feel good about yourself while also suppressing tension and anxiety-inducing hormones. Exercise also decreases the activity of the hormones, which induce anxiety and stress, therefore, making you feel better and eventually happy. Creating time to exercise helps you to be more energized, fit and generally happy. Lack of quality sleep can have many consequences to your overall health. You get restless and easily irritable when you haven’t had a proper night’s rest. All this can be resolved when you get quality sleep, experts recommend seven to eight hours as sufficient for adults. However, this may vary depending on your body, some people may be okay with an hour less while others an extra hour helps them feel well rested. Research shows that getting quality sleep will make you more productive, happier and healthier. Excessive clutter can often make your life feel chaotic and cause a lot of stress thus affecting your general outlook on life. It can affect every aspect of your life by weighing you down and slowing you from accomplishing your goals. From outdated apps, damaged furniture, or even social commitments. Anything you have not really used in the last 18 or so months should be cleared. It's not a good idea to let tangible items take up emotional space in your life. Allow it to go. Decluttering your life will declutter your mind as well allowing you to be more peaceful and have the energy for those things that really matter.  Everyone has unique attitudes and perspectives about life. Personal values that you hold dear  to your heart are a great part of what you believe in, thus they are foundational in understanding yourself and the things you care about. Knowing what beliefs and values are important in your life exudes happiness because it motivates you to be part of something bigger. Understanding what we value in life may be a big source of happiness because it inspires us to participate in activities that help us achieve our goals. As human beings, we care a lot about winning. We condemn failure and poor performances and are too hard on ourselves. This has a negative impact on your mindset as it brings you down dampening your winning spirit. Train your mind to appreciate every step of a task rather than the overall goal. Adopting this mindset will help you appreciate both the process and results. Take time to celebrate the small wins in your life. This can be something as simple as not snoozing your alarm clock, taking a lunch break, or even starting a new certification at ProMed. Research shows that altruism is hardwired into the brain. This explains why helping others can make you feel good. You often have heard the saying that, ‘it’s better to give than to receive. Helping others may be the secret to your own personal happiness. The key is to find a passion that aligns with the needs of those surrounding you. When this is discovered, you will be able to assist others by gaining a purpose, meaning, and happiness. \n",

      "Plan, collaborate, and publish thumb-stopping content Analyze social media performance and create reports Quickly navigate your comments and engage with your audience Build a customized landing page in minutes Generate ideas, repurpose posts, and rewrite copy in just a click I’m fascinated by the link between the way we live our daily lives and the health and happiness we enjoy. There are choices that you make every day, some of which seem completely unrelated to your health and happiness, that dramatically impact the way you feel mentally and physically. With that said, here are 10 common mistakes that can prevent you from being happy and healthy, and the science to back them up. When the Buffer team explored the science of happiness before on this blog, the interest was overwhelming. So I hope this can provide equally valuable insights: Ultimately, the human experience is about connecting with other people. Connection is what provides value and meaning to our lives. We’re wired for it and research proves just that. For example, people with strong social ties were found to be healthier and have a lower risk of death. Additionally, it was found that as age increases, the people with stronger social ties tend to live longer. And it seems that friendships can even help you fight cancer. The benefits of deep relationships extend to marriage as well. Being in a long-term relationship decreases the risk of depression, suicide, and substance abuse. And one study of almost 6,000 peoplefound that marriage led to increased longevity while never marrying was the strongest predictor of premature death. Finally, multiple studies (here, here, and here) show that strong family ties are one of the primary reasons the people of Okinawa, Japan have incredible longevity despite being one of the poorest prefectures in the country. What do all of these different studies tell us? Connection and belonging are essential for a healthy and happy life. Whether it’s friendship, marriage, or family — humans need close connections to be healthy. For more about the connection between loneliness and health, I suggest reading the New York Times best-seller Mind Over Medicine, which was written by my friend Dr. Lissa Rankin. You might want to stand up for this. The internet has gone crazy over an infographic that describes the harmful effects of sitting all day. The short version is that “recreational sitting” like sitting in front of a TV screen increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, regardless of your physical activity. Obviously, sitting at a desk for work isn’t too good either. This troubling data doesn’t come from small sample sizes either. These trends held true in one study with 4,500 people, another with 8,800 people, and a final one with over 240,000 participants. If you’re looking for more details on the health risks of sitting, this New York Times article covers some of the basics. Instead, try getting up and move around, it can be as simple as a quick walk around the desk: A few years ago, I was speaking with a yoga instructor who told me, “I think people love my class because it’s the only time in their entire day when they just sit and breathe.” That provides some interesting food for thought. From the time you wake up until the time you go to bed, do you ever take 15 minutes to just sit and breathe? I rarely do. And that’s a shame because the benefits of mindfulness and meditation are huge. Meditation reduces stress and anxiety. Meditation improves your quality of life and boost your immune system. Meditation has been shown to decrease anger and improve sleep, even among prison inmates. It can significantly reduce anxiety to just sit and breathe for as little as 10 minutes every day: There is an interesting and growing body of medical research that has discovered the positive health effects of religion and spirituality. The science doesn’t necessarily say that there is anything inherently healthy about religion, but it’s all the by-products that come from practicing religion that can make a big difference. For example, people with strong faith often release control of their struggles and worries to a higher power, which can help to relieve anxiety and stress. Religious groups also offer a strong source of community and friendships, which is critical for health and happiness. In many cases, the strength of friendships formed with fellow believers can last for decades, and those strong personal ties are crucial for long-term health. If you don’t consider yourself to be a religious person, then the lesson to takeaway from this body of research is that we all need a sense of belonging and community in our lives. It’s important to share your beliefs (whatever they happen to be about) with a community of people. People who have a community like that to lean on find themselves happier and healthier than those who lack that type of support. Community provides meaning in many people’s lives which according to Victor Frankl is the most important element for happiness. As a starting point, you can read studies on the religion-health connection here, here, and here. Expressing yourself creatively reduces the risk of disease and illness while simultaneously strengthening your health and wellness. For example, this study from the Harvard School of Public Health revealed that art helps to reduce stress and anxiety, increase positive emotions, and reduce the likelihood of depression, along with many other benefits. Another study, which was published in the Journal of Biobehavioral Medicine, discovered that creative writing improved the immune system response of HIV patients. For more ideas on why creating art is healthy, read this: The Health Benefits of Creativity. Every single one of us is incredibly creative, even if some people might have told us otherwise. It’s especially important to ignore the old “Left Brain, Right Brain” myth, stating that if you don’t use one side enough, you just aren’t creative: Exploring the world around you — whether that means traveling to faraway lands or hiking through the woods in your area — provides a wide range of mental and physical benefits. For starters, the benefits of sunlight (and the negative effects of artificial light) are well-documented in research. We know that not being outdoors enough significantly decreases our Vitamin D intake. We can easily avoid this, here is why: Additionally, researchers have begun to discover that wilderness excursions — known as “adventure therapy” — can promote weight loss, improve the self-esteem of people with mental illness, and evenreduce the rearrest rates of sex offenders. The central theme that runs through all of these studies is that exploring the outdoors and spending time in nature can increase the confidence you have in yourself and improve your ability to interact with others. On top of this, we also know that happiness is directly link to exercise. Contribution is an essential part of living a life that is happy, healthy, and meaningful. Too often we spend our lives consuming the world around us instead of creating it. We overdose on low quality information. We live sedentary lives and passively eat, watch, and soak up information rather than creating, contributing, and building our own things. As I wrote in this article… As you might expect, it’s dangerous to work too much. In Japan, the overtime and workplace stress has become so bad that they actually have a label for the people who die because of it: karoshi, which literally means “death by overwork.” Basically any way in which your job makes you feel stressed is bad for your health — unpredictable commutes, tension and disagreement with your boss or coworkers, feeling undervalued or unappreciated. Even working overtime increases the risk for coronary heart disease, independent of outside factors. What can you do about it? No one strategy will work for everyone, of course, but the principles in The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor offer a great place to start. Another crucial element to observe here is to fall in love with our body’s natural rhythm of working: The Ultradian Rhythm. Taking consistent breaks and not working for longer than ~90 minutes, can have a huge benefit for our health and feeling of happiness: Brian Wansink, a Cornell professor and author of Mindless Eating, has written that when people eat alone they are more likely to have a large binge feeding. Additionally, diets suffer when people eat alone. Lonely diners tend to eat fewer vegetables and less healthy meals. It seems that we make less of an effort to eat well when we are by ourselves than when someone else is involved. Given that an estimated one out of three people eat lunch at their desk, it’s easy to see how these little choices add up to big health problems over the long-term. Brene Brown is a researcher at the University of Houston and she has spent 10 years studying vulnerability. In recent years, her work has exploded with popularity as she delivered one of the most popular TED Talks of all-time and has written multiple best-selling books including Daring Greatlyand The Gifts of Imperfection. As Brown studied fear, uncertainty, and vulnerability, she discovered one key insight… If you allow your fear or vulnerability or shame to prevent you from showcasing your true self, then you will be preventing yourself from connecting fully with others. If you want to be able to move past fear, judgement, and uncertainty and into a healthier and happier life, then you have to give yourself permission first. You have to decide that you’re worthy. For much deeper and more useful discussion of vulnerability, I suggest reading Brown’s books:Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection. Living a healthy life is about much more than just diet and exercise. Don’t forget about the 10 areas above because they play a significant role in your health and happiness. As my friend Lissa Rankin often says, “What does your body need to heal?” In many cases it’s not a better diet or a new workout program, it’s one of these areas that might be impacting your health and happiness without you even realizing it.

      "    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.   There's an unfortunate reason why happiness is often elusive -- our brains simply aren't wired that way. Instead, our brains have evolved to survive, to protect ourselves, to keep us safe. Sure, we have moments of elation and periods of contentment and bliss. But many of us are plagued with persistent negative emotions -- we are just plain stuck in the \"blahs.\" How do we find more joy in our life? Like anything else, it takes practice to cultivate ongoing happiness. In a sense, we have to reset our baseline. It won't happen overnight, but here are the top 20 things you can do every day to discover the secrets of living a happier life. To find long-term happiness, you need to retrain your brain from a negative mindset to a positive mindset. Try these things: Spend one to two minutes looking for positives in your life. Do this three times a day for 45 days, and your brain will start doing it automatically. Choose a positive mantra for the day -- something you will repeat to yourself, such as \"Today is beautiful\" or \"I feel grateful for all I have.\" And when things go south, take a moment to try and see it from a positive light. Never underestimate the importance of recognizing the silver linings in life.

Creating balance in your life will reduce stress and give you other outlets to express yourself and have fun. Related: Work-Life Balance Is Simple. To Succeed at Work, Get a Life. Mindfulness mediation works by bringing your awareness and attention to the present moment. It's about being nonjudgmental and accepting how you are feeling.

Through mindfulness, we can find peace and affirmation in ourselves.

Such creative activities can include writing, painting, drawing and musical performance.

But in order to be a truly happy person, you must embrace the imperfection that is part of daily life. Perfection is impossible, and holding ourselves and others to these standards is futile. We will always end up feeling let down. Accept that life is imperfect and recognize that there is beauty and grace in that imperfection. Related: Perfection Is the Greatest Obstacle to Productivity It's pretty hard to maintain overall happiness if you hate your job. Don't waste the best years of your life in a joyless job, even if it's paying the bills. What are you interested in? What are you truly passionate about? Focus on building a career in an area that motivates you and will provide you with a high level of satisfaction, and your happiness mindset will go up exponentially. Related: 5 Essential Ingredients to Doing What You Love For a Living It's tempting to believe that the more money you have, the happier you'll be. But the reality is, it's how you spend your money that helps you feel happier. The key is to do it wisely. Spending money on experiences -- travel, dining, concerts and so on -- can make us happier because we are sharing those experiences with others. Happiness connected to material possessions fades, but experiences help us define our purpose and passions in life. Related: How to Use Your Time Wisely by Prioritizing Your Goals Our thoughts and feelings often revolve around the past or the future. Reality is what you are experiencing in this very moment; what you are going through right now. Sometimes we want to escape that reality.

It makes us feel better, in part because listening to music causes our brains to release dopamine, a neurochemical connected to pleasure and reward.

Related: 10 Crazy Effects Music Has on Your Brain One of the best things you can do to boost your happiness is to just be yourself. That means not being dependent on the approval of others, but accepting yourself for who you are. Spend some time getting to know yourself. What defines you? What do you believe in? Who are you, underneath it all? Search for ways to be comfortable in your own skin. Related: The Best-Kept Secret of Entrepreneurial Sales: Be Yourself Happiness, love, friendship and community go hand in hand. As humans, we have a fundamental need to interact and connect with others. We naturally seek our tribe -- the people who will support us, understand us and be there for us through life's roller-coaster ride. Without meaningful relationships, we are lonely and isolated. We're happier when we pursue happiness with others. Related: 25 Tips for Having Meaningful Relationships Stop comparing yourself to everyone around you.

Our connection to nature also plays a role in maintaining positive emotions and mental health. Related: Why You Should Take Your Work Outdoors Why do we love all things retro? Perhaps because nostalgia makes us happy. Nostalgic feelings, or reminiscing about our past, can help us reconnect with feelings of love and a sense of wonder and fulfillment.

Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test  Jump to section What is happiness? Where does happiness come from? Why is it so hard to be happy? How to find happiness: 6 methods 7 tips to help you achieve happiness Let yourself feel happy We all want to know how to find happiness. Whether you’re a recent college graduate or running a company, you’ve probably been looking for the answer to that question for a long time.  Unfortunately, sometimes your life’s responsibilities can keep you distracted from finding an answer. A demanding job, difficult coworkers, and confusion about your purpose in life are just a few examples of things that can get in the way. No matter how busy you are, though, you deserve to find happiness. Imagine how it would feel to wake up each day, calm and excited to take on your day. You’d love your job, be filled with a sense of purpose, and have plenty of time to spend with friends and family. No matter how happiness looks and feels to you, we’re here to help you find your way to it.  Let’s dive into the keys to being happy and how can you start finding happiness within yourself. Happiness is the feeling that washes over you when you experience positive emotions, interactions, or events. The brain responds to positive stimuli by releasing feel-good chemicals like dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins, sometimes known as happy hormones. Certain activities trigger your brain to release these hormones, like exercise, dancing, and meditation. But that boost of feel-good chemicals is situational, and it might go away when you stop that activity or leave a situation that makes you happy.  For example, runners typically experience a “high” after an intense run, resulting in a euphoric sensation that can last a few minutes to several hours. Similarly, taking risks stimulates the amygdala, a part of the brain that releases a combination of adrenaline and endorphins when it perceives that the body is in danger.  But that temporary rush of happy hormones doesn’t lead to a happier life. Life satisfaction is about more than exercise and taking risks. It’s about bettering yourself long-term, discovering what you’re good at, and protecting your energy. Healthy daily habits like eating a balanced diet and keeping a consistent sleep schedule are simple ways to improve your overall subjective well-being. But there are other factors that you have less control over, like your daily interactions, interpersonal relationships, and work-life balance, which are all subjective. The good news is there's always room to adjust your habits and foster a positive mental attitude to welcome more joy into your life.  Happiness doesn’t come from one place, particularly because people are so different. If you ask the people around you what makes them happy, you'll likely hear a lot of different answers.  One might respond that finding happiness means landing a prestigious job or getting a promotion. Another may define it as having lots of free time to spend on their hobbies. Someone else might argue that winning the lottery would make them the happiest person in the world.  But happiness goes beyond material goods. In fact, small day-to-day experiences and gestures are most likely to make you happy.  A study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts and Northwestern University tested out what makes people happy and how much material wealth impacts overall happiness.  They polled two very different participant groups: lottery winners and survivors of accidents. Each group was asked how much joy they received from everyday activities: a conversation with a friend or loved one, a good meal, and receiving a compliment. The lottery winners reported lower happiness levels than the survivors. The research suggests that rather than extreme material success, happiness appears in smaller, mundane moments — as long as you practice gratitude toward them. Although happiness can come from almost anywhere, focusing on the mundane joys you already experience can help you feel better.  If you’re experiencing a rough patch or emotional distress, happiness might seem far away, and that’s okay. Nobody can be happy all the time. In fact, according to the 2023 World Happiness Report, happiness levels in the U.S. are falling slightly every year. Many people associate happiness with achievements: switching careers, meeting a life partner, or making a big purchase. And it’s true that setting goals, working hard to make them happen, and successfully achieving them can contribute positively to your well-being. But happiness should be a side effect, not a goal.  One reason why it’s so hard to be happy is that happiness is a mindset, and it takes work to find. You might be looking for a one-size-fits-all answer, but living a happy life is more complex than that. Working to find the things that bring you joy — and incorporating them into your life — is the first step. There are no quick fixes to enjoying a stronger overall sense of satisfaction, but good habits can set you on the right path. Here are six ways to increase your happiness:  Chances are that many people depend on you: children, partners, parents, friends, and colleagues. This isn’t a bad thing, but it’s easy to become so distracted by taking care of others that you forget to take care of yourself.  Learn how to prioritize your physical and mental health and develop a self-care routine. Dedicating even a few small moments to yourself every day can give you space to breathe and improve your well-being.  Incorporate a few universal healthy choices into your daily life, like regular exercise, a nutritious diet, and sleep hygiene. But other habits can — and should — be subjective and unique to you. Explore what makes you feel like the best version of yourself.  Here are a few examples of habits and activities to try:  Try making time each day for extracurricular activities you enjoy. People who dedicate roughly two hours a day to free time activities experience higher overall well-being than people with less time for themselves. Two hours isn’t feasible for everyone, but even just a few minutes is a good place to start. Spend your free time on activities that you know are sources of happiness in your life. And if you aren’t sure what makes you happy yet, try new things. Making a new recipe, reading a book on a topic you like, and spending quality time with someone you love are all great options to start. Negative thoughts can affect your mood, both on a day-to-day basis and in the long term. If you find yourself ruminating over negative emotions or have a hard time letting go, try being more present. Mindfulness activities can help you live in the moment and appreciate the things you have rather than regret things you’ve done.  Mindfulness requires you to focus on what is immediately around you — sounds, smells, thoughts, and emotions — with curiosity and acceptance. Studies have found that people with higher levels of mindfulness also have higher levels of happiness and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety.  You might feel happy or sad without understanding why, and learning the reasons behind your feelings can help you better control them. Starting a journaling practice is one way to get in touch with your emotions and learn more about your feelings, fears, and needs. There are several ways to journal with happiness in mind. Gratitude journaling is about reflecting on the things you’re grateful for, like the care of a partner or a smile from a stranger, while anxiety journaling can help you work through negative feelings and discover what makes you feel better.  One way to bring more joy to your life is to spread it to others. Generosity directly impacts happiness on a neural level, and altruism and acts of kindness can bring positive interpersonal relationships into your life.  When you give back to your community, you may develop a more sympathetic understanding of others, find purpose, and feel connected to the people around you. Try volunteering for an organization you care about or helping a friend with an issue they’ve been having. Their gratitude alone can make you happier. Goal-setting stimulates a personal growth mindset and gives you concrete steps to improving your overall well-being. Even small goals, like finishing a book or going for a walk every day, can give you a sense of accomplishment and encourage you to dream bigger for your own happiness. The way you approach goals is important, too. Mistakes happen, and approaching them with positivity rather than negative self-talk can improve your experience and better prepare you for the next try. We all have bad days at work and at home. Nobody’s immune to a difficult coworker, a disagreement with a family member, or disappointing news. But a positive mindset can help you push through even the cloudiest of days. That doesn’t mean you have to be happy all the time. It’s about moving forward with a positive attitude.  To send you on your way, here are seven final tips to help you live a life with more joy:  Celebrate: Recognize your achievements with pride, even ones that seem small.  Rest: Prioritize good sleep and regular rest for your body to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to get to your day. Declutter: Analyze your life and avoid or adjust the things that don’t make you happy. This could be anything from redecorating your office space or ending relationships with toxic people.  Maintain your values: Pay attention to your worldview and personal values, and let them guide your behavior. Smile: Allow yourself to be carefree and find humor in everything, even when you make mistakes. Take control: Being happy is about you. Learn how to find it within yourself, not through external validation. Share: Surround yourself with positive influences and people who share your joy. Happiness is hard to find, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Everyone deserves to find happiness and cultivate a positive mindset that helps them enjoy the good and push through the bad.  Start by identifying the things you love and finding ways to work through the things you don’t. It might take work to adjust your priorities, especially when life gets busy. But living a happier life is worth it — and your joy will influence the people around you, too.

      "Happiness - it’s something we all aim for, along with health, wealth, and success in our endeavours. However, finding happiness in everyday life can be a difficult task. As a much sought-after emotional state, happiness can appear briefly, or be influenced by many other issues in our work and lives, making it difficult to find. In this guide, Calmer’s Founder, Tania Diggory, explores what happiness is, how to find happiness within yourself, and the simple steps you can try to feel happier on a regular basis. Happiness is the mental state of experiencing positive or pleasant emotions.  In my experience, many people define happiness as the feeling of intense joy, which may make it harder to feel like we’re happy in our everyday lives. In fact, there are many levels to happiness, starting from a sense of contentment, and ranging through to exhilarating jubilation. Many of us set off on a quest to reach exhilarating happiness highs on a regular basis, and this often ends in disappointment. Instead of happiness, try focusing on contentment. Contentment is the mental state of experiencing satisfaction in your present state. It is often felt when practicing mindfulness, or feeling comfortable in your mind, body, and surroundings. While we all experience a range of emotions each day, it can be helpful to practice finding contentment on a regular basis. Next time you take a tea break, or sit back after completing a piece of work, give yourself a minute or two to practice feeling good in your body, mind, and with your daily accomplishments. Now that I’ve introduced you to the concept of contentment, here’s six steps I tend to recommend to anyone looking to feel more positive in their daily life. Reframing how you view happiness, and where you get your happiness, can be simple changes that really make a difference. Here’s my six-step process to feeling happier in your life and your work:  Many people connect happiness to the achievement of certain goals or aspirations. This practice makes happiness a reward, rather than an emotion that is deserved to be felt on a day-to-day basis. Instead of chasing goals, and as an extension, chasing happiness, allow yourself to feel happiness whenever it comes your way.  Following on from point 1, the second downside to pinning happiness on external goals is that you may fall into unhelpful thinking habits. By placing your happiness onto something external, you may forget that feeling happy is something that comes from inside, and can be found by looking inward, rather than waiting for an external action to trigger it. Try reframing how you approach happiness, and instead of making it a long-awaited goal, consider what makes you happy on a regular basis. That may be time with family, friends, or a loved one, or doing a certain activity, such as painting, cycling, or cooking. Give yourself permission to schedule these moments of happiness into your life on a regular basis.  The third step is to practice looking inwards, with a view to discover happiness from within you. This is an activity that takes time and effort, but makes for a worthwhile habit. Start to regularly check-in with yourself, and identify how you feel. If you’re stressed, try implementing a stress-management strategy, or if you’re feeling like you could take better care of yourself, try setting up a self-care plan.  And if you need support in checking-in with your mental health and wellbeing, try joining the Calmer Community, our membership platform providing a range of activities and practices to do each month.  Once you’ve started checking-in with yourself, you can also begin to address any areas that may be troubling you. Often, internal problems can reduce self-esteem, so it may be worth spending some time looking after yourself. The NHS notes that focusing on self-esteem can make you happy, saying “The best way to improve your self-esteem is to treat yourself as you'd treat a valued friend, in a positive but honest way.” This is a great way to review how you look after yourself, especially if you also work for yourself. Thinking of yourself as your best boss, or your best friend, can help you to re-frame how you treat yourself and enable you to treat yourself in a kinder, fairer way. And on top of that, allow yourself to be vulnerable, even at work. Noting your problem areas, or your weaknesses, is an important first step in finding support for them or overcoming your issues altogether.  Similar to practicing looking inwards, taking time to be present across your day will enable you to truly take in your surroundings, and connect with your emotions on a deeper level. Practicing mindfulness at work is becoming a new strategy that businesses like Google and Facebook are encouraging their staff to do, so you may wish to try this in your role, or with your team. Being present may also enable you to experience happiness on a more regular basis, and on a deeper level.  The final step on my six-step process is to take time in appreciating yourself. Appreciate your work, your life, and your accomplishments. You can find happiness by simply reflecting on past happenings, some of them achievements, and others simply pleasant experiences.  If you’re a freelancer or entrepreneur, try reflecting on your journey on a regular basis. It’s easy to get swept up with future plans, and forget how well you’ve done previously. By focusing on your past experiences, you’ll not only re-experience the emotions that certain milestones brought, but also find ways to improve yourself and your business too. I hope that this guide has provided you with the simple steps to finding happiness on a more regular basis. If there’s only one thing you take away from this post, it’s to recognise that you have the power to feel happy within you, and with practice, it can be felt more frequently. As one of the UK’s leading mental health and wellbeing organisations supporting professionals and entrepreneurs, Calmer believes a happy mind makes for a happy business. Looking after yourself, and those around you, can enable you to work more productively and find business success too.

Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. happiness,  in psychology, a state of emotional well-being that a person experiences either in a narrow sense, when good things happen in a specific moment, or more broadly, as a positive evaluation of one’s life and accomplishments overall—that is, subjective well-being. Happiness can be distinguished both from negative emotions (such as sadness, fear, and anger) and also from other positive emotions (such as affection, excitement, and interest). This emotion often co-occurs with a specific facial expression: the smile. People from around the world tend to have a similar concept of happiness and can recognize happiness in others. As a result, the specific emotion of happiness is often included as one of a small number of basic emotions that cannot be broken down into more fundamental emotions and that may combine to form other, more complex emotions (in fact, it is sometimes the only positive emotion that is considered to be basic). Thus, happiness is an important concept for researchers who study emotions. An entire field of research has developed around the more inclusive concept of subjective well-being, which is characterized by a broad collection of happiness-related phenomena rather than a specific momentary emotion. As one might expect, people who are happy in this way tend to experience frequent positive emotions and infrequent negative emotions. This broader form of happiness is not purely emotional, however: it also has a cognitive component. When happy people are asked to think back on the conditions and events in their lives, they tend to evaluate these conditions and events positively. Thus, happy people report being satisfied with their lives and the various domains in their lives. Interestingly, these different components of happiness do not always co-occur within the same person. It is possible that someone could experience a great deal of negative emotions yet still acknowledge that the conditions of his or her life are good ones. For example, someone who works with the poor, the sick, or the destitute may experience frequent negative emotions but may also feel satisfied with life because the work is worthwhile. Similarly, people who spend lots of time engaging in hedonistic pleasures may experience frequent momentary positive emotions, but they may also feel that life is empty and meaningless. Subjective well-being researchers are interested in the various factors that influence these distinct components. Psychologists are interested in happiness for two reasons. First, psychologists study happiness because laypeople are interested in happiness. When people from around the world are asked to list the things that are most important to them, happiness consistently tops the list. People rank attaining happiness as being more important than acquiring money, maintaining good health, and even going to heaven. Psychologists believe that they can help people achieve this goal of being happy by studying the factors that are associated with happiness. A second reason why psychologists study happiness is because a person’s evaluative responses to the world may provide information about the basic characteristics of human nature. One of the most basic principles guiding psychological theory is that people and animals are motivated to approach things in the world that cause pleasure and to avoid things in the world that cause pain. Presumably, this behavior results from adaptive mechanisms that guide organisms toward resources and away from dangers. If so, the evaluative reactions of many people about the world should be useful and revealing. For instance, some psychologists have suggested that human beings have a basic need to experience strong and supportive social relationships. They point to evidence from the field of subjective well-being to support their claim—a person’s social relationships are reliably linked to his or her happiness. Thus, cataloging the correlates of happiness should provide important information about the features of human nature. The results of scientific studies reveal several trends. For instance, when researchers ask people to report on their happiness, their answers tend to be consistent over time: people who say they are happy now also tend to say that they are happy when asked again in the future. Because the conditions in people’s lives don’t usually change that frequently, the stability of happiness measures provides support for the idea that these measures truly do tap this important construct. In addition, research shows that when life events do occur, people’s reports of happiness change in response. Perhaps more importantly, when psychologists try to assess happiness in a variety of different ways, these measures all seem to converge on the same answer. For instance, when researchers ask people to provide self-reports of happiness, they tend to agree with informant-reports of happiness—that is, ratings provided by friends and acquaintances. Furthermore, psychological tests—such as those that ask subjects to list as many positive memories as they can within a minute—may also determine who is happy without even asking for an explicit judgment of happiness, and, again, these measures tend to agree with self-reports. Psychologists can even find evidence of happiness in the brain: certain patterns of brain activity are reliably associated with happiness. When psychologists track people’s levels of happiness, most people report being in mildly positive moods most of the time. In addition, when psychologists ask people to rate their overall life satisfaction, most people report scores that are above neutral. This research finding is not limited to relatively well-off samples (like the college students who are often asked to participate in psychological studies). Instead, it has been replicated in many different populations in many nations around the world. Thus, when psychologists study the correlates of happiness, they are usually looking for factors that distinguish the very happy from the mildly happy rather than the happy from the miserable. Psychologists have arrived at several surprising conclusions in their search for predictors of happiness. Many of the factors that may first come to mind do not seem to play a major role in happiness. For example, although people strive to acquire high-paying jobs and dream about winning the lottery, income is not strongly correlated with happiness. Wealthy people are happier than poorer people, but the difference is not very large. As one might expect, the association between money and happiness is strongest among very poor groups and among poor countries. Income leads to smaller and smaller gains in happiness as income levels rise. Health also plays a role in subjective well-being, but the associations are, again, surprisingly small. Surveys of representative populations show that objective measures (including doctors’ reports, hospital visits, and lists of symptoms) are very weakly correlated with happiness. Subjective reports (such as a person’s own evaluation of his or her health) tend to correlate more strongly, but even these associations are, at most, moderate in size. In addition, although people with major health problems, such as paralyzing spinal-cord injuries, are quite a bit less happy than uninjured people, the difference is not as large as some might expect. Even people with very serious illnesses tend to report happiness scores that are above neutral. The factor that has been most closely linked to high levels of happiness is social relationships. Research consistently shows that people who have strong social relationships tend to report higher levels of well-being. As with other domains, subjective reports of relationship quality and relationship satisfaction tend to exhibit the highest correlations with subjective well-being. But even more objective measures, including the number of close friends a person has, the number of social organizations to which the person belongs, and the amount of time the person spends with others, all show small to moderate correlations with happiness. As one might expect based on this research, specific types of social relationships are also important for subjective well-being. For instance, marital status is one of the strongest demographic predictors of happiness. Married people consistently report higher levels of happiness than single people, who report greater happiness than the widowed, divorced, or separated. Interestingly, however, it does not appear that marriage itself causes higher levels of subjective well-being. Longitudinal studies show that people only receive a small boost in happiness around the time they get married, and they quickly adapt to baseline levels. The differences between married and unmarried people are due primarily to the lasting negative effects of divorce and widowhood, along with selection effects that might actually predispose happy people to marry. Other demographic characteristics also show weak associations with happiness. Religious people tend to report greater happiness than nonreligious people, though the size of these effects varies depending on whether religious beliefs or religious behaviors are measured. Factors such as intelligence, education, and job prestige are also only slightly related to well-being. Happiness does not seem to change dramatically over the course of the life span, except perhaps at the very end of the life when declines are somewhat steep. In addition, sex differences in subjective well-being are not large. In contrast to the relatively weak effects of external circumstance, research shows that internal factors play a strong role in subjective well-being. Individual differences in happiness-related variables emerge early in life, are stable over time, and are at least partially heritable. For instance, behavioral genetic studies show that identical twins who were reared apart are quite a bit more similar in their levels of happiness than are fraternal twins who were reared apart. This suggests that genes play an important role. Most estimates put the heritability of subjective well-being components at around 40–50 percent for positive emotional states and between 30–40 percent with respect to the negative emotional states of depression and anxiety. Personality researchers have shown that at least some of these genetic effects may be due to the influence of specific personality traits on happiness. For example, the stable personality trait of extraversion is moderately correlated with positive affect (that is, the feeling of a positive emotion) and, to a lesser extent, with life satisfaction and negative affect (that is, the feeling of a negative emotion). People who are outgoing, assertive, and sociable tend to report more intense and more frequent positive emotions. This association is so robust that some psychologists have even suggested that the two constructs—extraversion and positive affect—are controlled by the same underlying physiological systems. Similarly, researchers have shown that the basic personality trait of neuroticism is moderately to strongly correlated with negative affect (and again, to a lesser extent, with life satisfaction and positive affect). This and other research on the links between happiness and traits (including factors such as optimism and self-esteem) show that personality plays a strong role in people’s subjective well-being. There is a popular notion that the way that people view the world should influence their happiness. Some people always look for the silver lining in things, and presumably this positive outlook shapes the emotions that they feel. Psychologists, too, believe that the way that one thinks about the world is related to characteristic levels of happiness. A great deal of research has been conducted to examine the cognitive processes that affect a person’s subjective well-being. For instance, many researchers examine the role that social comparison processes play in happiness. Initially, psychologists thought that people evaluated the conditions in their own lives by comparing them with the conditions in other people’s lives. Those individuals who are worse off than the people around them (in other words, people who experience upward comparisons) should experience unhappiness; those individuals who are better off than the people around them (in other words, people who experience downward comparisons) would experience happiness. Although this effect can occur, other research suggests that the processes are a bit more complicated. For one thing, both upward and downward comparisons can lead to either increases or decreases in happiness. People may look to someone who is better off and think either that they are performing terribly in comparison or that the other person serves as an example of an achievement toward which they can strive. Obviously, these two interpretations should lead to different effects on happiness. In addition, research shows that happy and unhappy people often choose different people for comparison. Happy people may choose comparison people who serve to maintain their happiness; unhappy people may choose comparisons that lead to less happiness. Thus, social comparison affects happiness in complicated ways. Psychologists have also shown that goals and aspirations influence happiness. Not surprisingly, people who are rapidly approaching a goal tend to experience higher levels of happiness than people who are approaching a goal more slowly. But research also shows that simply having important goals is associated with greater happiness. Presumably, the sense of purpose that these goals create may protect people from the negative effects of temporary setbacks. Interestingly, the specific goals that people choose may also affect their happiness. Research suggests that choosing goals that are a challenge but not unachievable is important. Although people tend to think about happiness as an outcome that they desire rather than as a tool that can be used to achieve additional goals, psychologists have begun to ask what function happiness serves. One of the best known theories, developed by American psychologist Barbara Fredrickson in 1998, posits that the function of happiness (or more precisely, the function of positive emotions) is to broaden one’s thinking and to build one’s resources. According to this theory, positive emotions lead people to think creatively and to try new things. As a result, happy people can develop new ways to approach the world, new interests, new social relationships, and even new physical skills. All of these effects lead to positive outcomes in people’s lives. Psychologists have begun using experimental and longitudinal studies to determine whether positive affect plays a role in future positive outcomes. These studies provide evidence that happy people are more sociable and cooperative than unhappy people, are healthier than unhappy people, and earn more money than unhappy people. A number of studies have even shown that happy people live longer than unhappy people (and this is not just due to the fact that happy people tend to be healthy). Thus, although most people want to be happy because it feels good, this desired goal may lead to other positive outcomes in their lives.\n"

      " Happiness is a positive and pleasant emotion, ranging from contentment to intense joy. Moments of happiness may be triggered by positive life experiences or thoughts, but sometimes it may arise from no obvious cause. The level of happiness for longer periods of time is more strongly correlated with levels of life satisfaction, subjective well-being, flourishing and eudaimonia. In common usage, the word happy can be an appraisal of those measures themselves or as a shorthand for a \"source\" of happiness (for example, \"find happiness in life\" as in finding the meaning in life). As with any emotion, the precise definition of happiness has been a perennial debate in philosophy.\n",

Subjective well-being (swb)[b] includes measures of current experience (emotions, moods, and feelings) and of life satisfaction.[c] For instance Sonja Lyubomirsky has described happiness as \"the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one's life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.\"[24] Eudaimonia,[25] is a Greek term variously translated as happiness, welfare, flourishing, and blessedness. Xavier Landes[14] has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective wellbeing, mood and eudaimonia.[15]\n",
      " These differing uses can give different results.[26] Whereas Nordic countries often score highest on swb surveys, South American countries score higher on affect-based surveys of current positive life experiencing.[27]\n",
      " The implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context,[28] qualifying happiness as a polyseme and a fuzzy concept.\n",
      " A further issue is when measurement is made; appraisal of a level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date.[29][30]\n",
      " Some users accept these issues, but continue to use the word because of its convening power.[31]\n",
      " German philosophy professor Michela Summa says that the distinction between joy and happiness is that \"joy accompanies the process through and through, whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process... joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life-concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment, whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one's life or one's own life as a whole.\"[32]\n",
      " People have been trying to measure happiness for centuries. In 1780, the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing.[33]\n",
      " Today, happiness is typically measured using self-report surveys. Self-reporting is prone to cognitive biases and other sources of errors, such as peak–end rule. Studies show that memories of felt emotions can be inaccurate.[34] Affective forecasting research shows that people are poor predictors of their future emotions, including how happy they will be.[35]\n",
      " Happiness economists are not overly concerned with philosophical and methodological issues and continue to use questionaries to measure average happiness of populations.\n",
      " Several scales have been developed to measure happiness:\n",
      " Since 2012, a World Happiness Report has been published. Happiness is evaluated, as in \"How happy are you with your life as a whole?\", and in emotional reports, as in \"How happy are you now?,\" and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness. In subjective well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports.[45]\n",
      " The UK began to measure national well-being in 2012,[46] following Bhutan, which had already been measuring gross national happiness.[47][48]\n",
      " Academic economists and international economic organizations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. There are many different contributors to adult wellbeing, such as the point that happiness judgements partly reflect the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.[49] Although these factors play a role in happiness, they do not all need to improve simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness.\n",
      " Happiness has been found to be quite stable over time.[50][51]\n",
      " As of 2016[update], no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found; the topic is being researched at the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.[52]\n",
      "A positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain's gray matter in the right precuneus area and one's subjective happiness score.[53]\n",
      " Sonja Lyubomirsky has estimated that 50 percent of a given human's happiness level could be genetically determined, 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation, and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self-control.[54][55]\n",
      " When discussing genetics and their effects on individuals it is important to first understand that genetics do not predict behavior. It is possible for genes to increase the likelihood of individuals being happier compared to others, but they do not 100 percent predict behavior.\n",
      " At this point in scientific research, it has been hard to find a lot of evidence to support this idea that happiness is affected in some way by genetics. In a 2016 study, Michael Minkov and Michael Harris Bond found that a gene by the name of SLC6A4 was not a good predictor of happiness level in humans.[56]\n",
      " On the other hand, there have been many studies that have found genetics to be a key part in predicting and understanding happiness in humans.[57] In a review article discussing many studies on genetics and happiness, they discussed the common findings.[58] The author found an important factor that has affected scientist findings this being how happiness is measured. For example, in certain studies when subjective wellbeing is measured as a trait heredity is found to be higher, about 70 to 90 percent. In another study, 11,500 unrelated genotypes were studied, and the conclusion was the heritability was only 12 to 18 percent. Overall, this article found the common percent of heredity was about 20 to 50 percent.[59]\n",
      " Theories on how to achieve happiness include \"encountering unexpected positive events\",[60] \"seeing a significant other\",[61] and \"basking in the acceptance and praise of others\".[62]\n",
      "Some others believe that happiness is not solely derived from external, momentary pleasures.[63]\n",
      " Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes, and Seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including \"the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.\"[64] The psychiatrist George Vaillant and the director of longitudinal Study of Adult Development at Harvard University Robert J. Waldinger found that those who were happiest and healthier reported strong interpersonal relationships.[65] Research showed that adequate sleep contributes to well-being.[66] Good mental health and good relationships contribute more to happiness than income does.[67] In 2018, Laurie R. Santos course titled \"Psychology and the Good Life\" became the most popular course in the history of Yale University and was made available for free online to non-Yale students.[68]\n",
      " Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.[69] Kahneman has said that \"“When you look at what people want for themselves, how they pursue their goals, they seem more driven by the search for satisfaction than the search for happiness.”[70]\n",
      " Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II, noticed that those who lost hope soon died, while those who held to meaning and purpose tended to live on. Frankl observed that joy and misery had more to do with a person's perspective and choice than with their surroundings. Three key sources of meaning that he highlights in his writings include the following:[71]\n",
      " Psychologist Robert Emmons has identified the centrality of goals in pursuing happiness. He found that when humans pursue meaningful projects and activities without primarily focusing on happiness, happiness often results as a by-product. Indicators of meaningfulness predict positive effects on life, while lack of meaning predicts negative states such as psychological distress. Emmons summarizes the four categories of meaning which have appeared throughout various studies. He proposes to call them WIST, or work, intimacy, spirituality, and transcendence.[72]\n",
      " Throughout life, one's views of happiness and what brings happiness can evolve. In early and emerging adulthood many people focus on seeking happiness through friends, objects, and money. Middle aged-adults generally transition from searching for object-based happiness to looking for happiness in money and relationships. In older adulthood, people tend to focus more on personal peace and lasting relationships (ex. children, spouse, grandchildren).[73]  Antti Kauppinen, a Swedish philosopher and phenomenological researcher, posited that the perception of time affects the change in focus throughout life. In early adulthood, most view life optimistically, looking to the future and seeing an entire life ahead of them. Those that fall into the middle life, see that life has passed behind them as well as seeing more life ahead. Those in older adulthood often see their lives as behind them. This shift in perspective causes a shift in the pursuit of happiness from more tactile, object based happiness, to social and relational based happiness.[74]\n",
      " Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached.[75] Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.[76] The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time. Our intense focus causes us to forget any other issues, which in return promotes positive emotions.[77]\n",
      " Erich Fromm said \"Happiness is the indication that man has found the answer to the problem of human existence: the productive realization of his potentialities and thus, simultaneously, being one with the world and preserving the integrity of his self. In spending his energy productively he increases his powers, he „burns without being consumed.\"\"[78]\n",
      " Self-determination theory relates intrinsic motivation to three needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness.[79] Competence refers to an individual's ability to be effective in their interactions with the environment, autonomy refers to a person's flexibility in choice and decision making, and relatedness is the need to establish warm, close personal relationships.[80]\n",
      " Ronald Inglehart has traced cross-national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the World Values Survey.[81] He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When basic needs are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained.[82]\n",
      " Sigmund Freud said that all humans strive after happiness, but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we \"are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the state of things.\"[83]\n",
      " The idea of motivational hedonism is the theory that pleasure is the aim for human life.[84]\n",
      " Since 2000 the field of positive psychology, which focuses on the study of happiness and human flourishing rather than maladjusted behavior or illness, expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications. It has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness, such as positive social interactions with family and friends.[85]\n",
      " These factors include six key virtues:\n",
      " 1. Wisdom and knowledge, which includes creativity, curiosity, love of learning and open-mindedness.\n",
      " 2. Courage, which includes bravery, persistence, integrity, and vitality.\n",
      " 3. Humanity, which includes love, kindness, and social intelligence.\n",
      " 4. Justice, which includes leadership, fairness, and loyalty.\n",
      " 5. Temperance, which includes self-regulation, prudence, forgiveness, humility, and modesty.\n",
      " 6. Transcendence, which includes religious/spirituality, hope, gratitude, appreciation of beauty and excellence, and humor.\n",
      " In order for a virtue to be considered a key strength in the field of positive psychology it must meet the demands of 12 criteria, namely ubiquity (cross-cultural), fulfilling, morally valued, does not diminish others, be a nonfelicitous opposite (have a clear antonym that is negative), traitlike, measurable, distinct, have paragons (distinctly show up in individuals’ behaviors), have prodigies (show up in youth), be selectively absent (distinctly does not show up in some individuals), and is supported by some institutions.[86][87]\n",
      " Numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness.[88][89]\n",
      " A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous Framingham Heart Study indicate that friends three degrees of separation away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: \"A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%.\"[90]\n",
      " Various writers, including Camus and Tolle, have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy.[91][92][93][94]\n",
      " John Stuart Mill believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on one's happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would \"inhale happiness with the air you breathe.\"[d]\n",
      " William Inge said that \"on the whole, the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except the fact that they are so.\"[97] Orison Swett Marden said that \"some people are born happy.\"[e]\n",
      " Cognitive behavioral therapy is a popular therapeutic method used to change habits by changing thoughts and problematic behaviors. It focuses on emotional regulation and uses a lot of positive psychology practices. It is often used for people with depression, anxiety, or addictions and works towards how to lead a happier life.[99] Common processes in cognitive behavioral therapy are reframing thoughts from problematic thinking patterns by replacing them with beneficial or supportive ones, roleplaying, finding beneficial coping skills, and choosing new activities that support desired behaviors and avoid negative behaviors.[100]\n",
      " Coined by Harvard professor of psychology and author of \"Stumbling on Happiness\", Daniel Gilbert, synthetic happiness is the happiness we make for ourselves. In his TedTalk titled, the surprising science of happiness, Gilbert explains that everyone possesses a \"psychological immune system\" that helps to regulate our emotional reactions.[101] Through research that he studied and held, he and his team found that personal happiness is largely based on personal perception. Synthetic happiness as an idea has become more popular as people attempt to define happiness as a journey instead of a destination.[citation needed]\n",
      " Happiness research understands \"happiness\" as \"life satisfaction\" or \"well-being\". Since it has proved difficult to find a definition of happiness, individual people are instead asked how happy they feel.[102] Numerous surveys are then summarized and analyzed using static methods. Although some researchers believe that the scales are fundamentally unsuitable for estimating happiness,[103] other researchers argue that the happiness indices formed on the basis of the survey have a high statistical correspondence with characteristics that are generally understood to indicate a happy person. For example, individuals who report high happiness on scales smile more often, exhibit more social behavior, are more helpful, and are less likely to commit suicide. For this reason, happiness indices determined on the basis of the survey are considered reliable by happiness researchers.[104]\n",
      " Before recommending strategies, it is crucial to rely on rigorous, large-scale experiments that confirm their effectiveness. Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in what constitutes 'high-quality evidence' in psychology (there were adopted e. g. practices like pre-registration, committing to specific methodological and analytical decisions in advance, and increased sample sizes to avoid underpowered studies). A meta analysis of 2023 has used this modern evidence-based approach, evaluating evidence for common happiness-boosting strategies. The study aimed to shed light on the effectiveness of these strategies and their impact on subjective well-being. As a first step, the autors analyzed numerous media articles on happiness to identify the five most commonly recommended strategies, these were: expressing gratitude, enhancing sociability, exercising, practicing mindfulness/meditation, and increasing exposure to nature. Next, the  published scientific literature was searched but limited to the above-described high-quality criteria that tested the effects of these strategies on subjective well-being in everyday individuals (non-clinical samples). Only 10% of the initially retrieved studies met those rigorous criteria. The findings revealed that unlike so far suggested by scientific studies, there is currently still a lack of robust scientific evidence to support some of the most frequently suggested happiness strategies. Among the five most common happiness strategies, there was \"reasonably solid evidence\" of positive effects from a) Gratitude messages or lists, b) conversations with strangers or  Gratitude and sociability - that is, establishing and maintaining social relationships. In contrast, no convincing evidence could be found that c) sports, d) mindfulness training, or e) walks in the countryside make people happier.[105]\n",
      " There is a wealth of cross-sectional studies on happiness and physical health that shows consistent positive relationships.[106] Follow-up studies appear to show that happiness does not predict longevity in sick populations, but that it does predict longevity among healthy populations.[107]\n",
      " Other positive effects of happiness and being in a good mood, that have been studied and confirmed, are that happier people tend to be more helpful, attentive, and generous to others,[108] as well as to themselves.[109] Happy people also have been shown to act more cooperatively and less aggressively,[110] and be more likely to help others in need.[111] They were also found to be more sociable and communicative.[112]\n",
      " More positive effects that happiness seems to evoke are creative problem solving,[113] persisting through challenges,[114] more intrinsic motivation for work related or responsible tasks,[115] and being more effective at using efficient decision-making strategies.[116]\n",
      " While some believe that success breeds happiness, Lyubomirsky, King and Diener found that happiness precedes success in income, relationships, marriages, work performance, and health.[117]\n",
      " Low mood is correlated with many negative life outcomes such as suicide, poor health, substance abuse, and low life expectancy. By extension, happiness protects from those negative outcomes.\n",
      " June Gruber argued that happiness may trigger a person to be more sensitive, more gullible, less successful, and more likely to undertake high risk behaviours.[118][119] She also conducted studies suggesting that seeking happiness can have negative effects, such as failure to meet over-high expectations.[120][121][122] Iris Mauss has shown that the more people strive for happiness, the more likely they will set up too high of standards and feel disappointed.[123][124]  One study shows that women who value happiness more tend to react less positively to happy emotions.[125] A 2012 study found that psychological well-being was higher for people who experienced both positive and negative emotions.[126][127]\n",
      " Jeremy Bentham believed that public policy should attempt to maximize happiness, and he even attempted to estimate a \"hedonic calculus\". Thomas Jefferson put the \"pursuit of happiness\" on the same level as life and liberty in the United States Declaration of Independence. Presently, many countries and organizations regularly measure population happiness through large-scale surveys, e.g., Bhutan.\n",
      " Richer nations tend to have higher measures of happiness than poorer nations.[128][129] The relationship between wealth and happiness is not linear and the same GDP increase in poor countries will have more effect on happiness than in wealthy countries.[130][131][132][133]\n",
      " Some political scientists argue that life satisfaction is positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions.[134][135][136] Others argue that happiness is strongly correlated with economic freedom,[137] preferably within the context of a western mixed economy, with free press and a democracy.\n",
      " Personal happiness can be affected by cultural factors.[138][139][140] Hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures.[141] Forcing people to marry and stay married can have adverse consequences. Research has shown that unhappily married couples suffer 3–25 times the risk of developing clinical depression.[142][143][144]\n",
      " One theory is that higher SWB in richer countries is related to their more individualistic cultures. Individualistic cultures may satisfy intrinsic motivations to a higher degree that collectivistic cultures, and fulfilling intrinsic motivations, as opposed to extrinsic motivations, may relate to greater levels of happiness, leading to more happiness in individualistic cultures.[145]\n",
      " Cultural views on happiness have changed over time.[146] For instance Western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century.[147] Not all cultures seek to maximize happiness,[148][nb 1][nb 2] and some cultures are averse to happiness.[149][150] It has been found in Western cultures that individual happiness is the most important. Some other cultures have opposite views and tend to be aversive to the idea of individual happiness. For example, people living in Eastern Asian cultures focus more on the need for happiness within relationships with others and even find personal happiness to be harmful to fulfilling happy social relationships.[149][148][151][nb 1][nb 2]\n",
      " People in countries with high cultural religiosity tend to relate their life satisfaction less to their emotional experiences than people in more secular countries.[152]\n",
      " Happiness forms a central theme of Buddhist teachings.[153] For ultimate freedom from suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leads its practitioner to Nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. Ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. More mundane forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people (see sukha). Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings.[154][155][unreliable source?][unreliable source?]\n",
      " In Advaita Vedanta, the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between Atman and Brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all.\n",
      " Patanjali, author of the Yoga Sutras, wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss.[156]\n",
      " The Chinese Confucian thinker Mencius, who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China's Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the \"lesser self\" (the physiological self) and the \"greater self\" (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood.[157] He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's \"vital force\" with \"righteous deeds\", then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music.[158]\n",
      " Happiness or simcha (Hebrew: שמחה) in Judaism is considered an important element in the service of God.[159] The biblical verse \"worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs,\" (Psalm 100:2) stresses joy in the service of God.[160] A popular teaching by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is \"Mitzvah Gedolah Le'hiyot Besimcha Tamid,\" it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.[161][self-published source?]\n",
      " The primary meaning of \"happiness\" in various European languages involves good fortune, blessing, or a similar happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy refers primarily to ethics.\n",
      " In Christianity, the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek eudaimonia (\"blessed happiness\"), described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian Thomas Aquinas as a beatific vision of God's essence in the next life.[162]\n",
      " According to Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, man's last end is happiness: \"all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.\"[163] Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to virtue.[164]\n",
      " According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an \"operation of the speculative intellect\": \"Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things.\" And, \"the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect.\" So: \"Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions.\"[165]\n",
      " Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. Beatitudo, or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.[166]\n",
      " Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), the Sufi thinker, wrote that \"The Alchemy of Happiness\", is a manual of religious instruction that is used throughout the Muslim world and widely practiced today.[167]\n",
      " Philosophy of happiness is often discussed in conjunction with ethics.[168] Traditional European societies, inherited from the Greeks and from Christianity, often linked happiness with morality. In this context, morality was the performance in a specific role in a certain kind of social life.[169]\n",
      " Happiness remains a difficult term for moral philosophy. Throughout the history of moral philosophy, there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness or defining it as nothing to do with happiness at all.[170]\n",
      " In psychology, connections between happiness and morality have been studied in a variety of ways. Empirical research suggests that laypeople's judgments of a person's happiness in part depend on perceptions of that person's morality, suggesting that judgments of others' happiness involve moral evaluation.[171] A large body of research also suggests that engaging in prosocial behavior can increase happiness.[172][173][174]\n",
      " Ethicists have made arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. Utilitarians, such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, advocated the greatest happiness principle as a guide for ethical behavior. This principle states that actions are proportionately right or wrong by how much happiness or unhappiness they bring. Mill defines happiness as that which brings about an intended pleasure and avoids an unnecessary pain, and he defines unhappiness as the reverse, namely an action that brings about pain and not pleasure. He is quick to specify that pleasure and pain are to be understood in an Epicurean light, referring chiefly to the higher human pleasures of increased intellect, feelings, and moral sentiments not what one might call beastly pleasures of mere animal appetites.[175] Critics of this view include Thomas Carlyle, Ferdinand Tönnies and others within the German philosophical tradition. They posit that a greater happiness is to be found in choosing to suffer for others, rather than allowing others to suffer for them, declaring this to be a form of satisfying, and heroic, nobility.[176]\n",
      " Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and well-being.[177][178] In a study of older adults, those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live, and less depression, anxiety, and somatization.[179] Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages.[177][180][181] One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over 30 years and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one.[182] A study on adults aged 55 and older found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.[183]\n",
      " Aristotle described eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) as the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is often translated to mean happiness, but some scholars contend that \"human flourishing\" may be a more accurate translation.[184] Aristotle's use of the term in Nicomachiean Ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness.[185]\n",
      " In the Nicomachean Ethics, written in 350 BCE, Aristotle stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy.[186] For Aristotle the term eudaimonia, which is translated as 'happiness' or 'flourishing' is an activity rather than an emotion or a state.[187] Eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a classical Greek word consists of the word \"eu\" (\"good\" or \"well-being\") and \"daimōn\" (\"spirit\" or \"minor deity\", used by extension to mean one's lot or fortune). Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way.[188]\n",
      " Specifically, Aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity. He arrived at this claim with the \"Function Argument\". Basically, if it is right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For Aristotle human function is to reason, since it is that alone which humans uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is good. According to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle argued a second-best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue.[188]\n",
      " The key question Aristotle seeks to answer is \"What is the ultimate purpose of human existence?\" A lot of people are seeking pleasure, health, and a good reputation. It is true that those have a value, but none of them can occupy the place of the greatest good for which humanity aims. It may seem like all goods are a means to obtain happiness, but Aristotle said that happiness is always an end in itself.[189]\n",
      " Friedrich Nietzsche critiqued the English Utilitarians' focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that \"Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does\".[190] Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate goal and the aim of one's existence, in his words \"makes one contemptible.\" Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than \"mere happiness.\" He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the \"last man\" as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers.[191][192]\n",
      " These small, \"last men\" who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.[191][193]\n",

      "We are stardust that somehow came alive and no one knows how or why that happened – no one knows what created life. Yet here we are – alive on a tiny speck of dirt and water floating through endless space. For most people including us, this mystery called life is most sacred, and it fills us with awe and wonder. This site is about how to relax into this mystery and be present in it every moment. This site is about being more aware of what’s obvious, not about finding something that’s hidden or lost. It’s about connecting with what’s sacred through your experiences, not through beliefs or faith. Our experience is that life itself is already so sacred that reverence is enough – that faith and beliefs need not even figure in unless you want them to. In short, this site is about how to replace words and thoughts about life with your direct experiences of life, and how to then evaluate and trust your experiences. It is about connecting directly with sacredness through increasing inner peace, love, fellowship, and goodness in your life. “Altogether, the results of the neuroscience of religion thus far suggest strongly that a religious instinct does indeed exist … [but] … surely there exist ways to find spiritual fulfillment without surrender and enslavement.” Edward O. Wilson;  The Meaning of Human Existence;The Social Conquest of Earth   Long ago our ancestors created religions and spiritualities that promised inner peace, love, fellowship, goodness, and connection with what’s most sacred. Today most people still want those promises fulfilled but many now distrust traditional religions and spiritualities because those often divide society and separate people from one another. The view on this web site is that traditional religions and spiritualities do provide ways to fulfill those promises, and some of those ways are described on this site along with new ways of fulfilling those promises developed by medicine and science in recent years. However our view is also that traditional religions and spiritualities are based on a flawed principle that undermines the fulfillment of those promises, that divides society, and that separates people from one another: Traditional religions and a great many spiritual teachings today are based on the flawed principle that someone else knows better than you what’s best for you. They require you to accept that they alone know how to connect you with what’s sacred and provide you with inner peace, love, fellowship and goodness. By accepting that requirement you thereby give them your power and your authority, which disempowers you and empowers them. They can then tell you what’s best for you because you gave them the power and authority to do so. This web site is based on a different principle, which is that you know better than anyone what actually works best for you; that you know better than anyone what increases or decreases your inner peace and brings you closer to what’s most sacred. With this approach you do not give your power to some other authority – you retain your power and you are the authority. With this approach you continue to learn by watching how others do things but you then decide what works best in your life. With this approach you choose friends and advisors who agree to be good listeners and provide their perspectives, and to respect you by not pushing their agendas and beliefs on you. In short, this web site is about learning to trust yourself and build your self-confidence. It’s about learning to connect with your intuition and trust what it’s telling you. It’s about learning to see and think for yourself. Through your own eyes you learned what the moon looks like: how could you learn that through the eyes of someone else? In that same way learn for yourself what expands inner peace, love, fellowship, goodness and what is most sacred in your life. Good luck. “Thank you for your wonderful website and instructions.

      "Home Healthy living Mental wellbeing Low mood and depression How to feel happier Try our 6 tips to help you be happier, more in control, and able to cope better with life’s ups and downs. If you have a lot of stress in your life, find ways to reduce it, such as learning a few time-management techniques or talking to your boss about changing your working hours. Introduce regular exercise and time to yourself. These are positive changes. Taking control of your time in this way can effectively reduce stress. If you have feelings of anxiety along with your stress, breathing techniques can help. Try this breathing exercise for stress. Try to see the funny side of situations and you’ll often be able to cope better. Jokes have a way of making worries seem less important. Doing things that you enjoy is also good for your emotional wellbeing. Simple activities like watching sports with a friend, having a soak in the bath, or meeting up with friends for coffee can all improve your day. Doing something you’re good at, such as cooking or dancing, is a good way to enjoy yourself and have a sense of achievement. Try to avoid things that seem enjoyable at the time but make you feel worse afterwards, such as drinking too much alcohol or eating junk food. Self-esteem is the way you feel about yourself. The best way to improve your self-esteem is to treat yourself as you would treat a valued friend, in a positive but honest way. Notice when you’re putting yourself down, such as thinking, “You’re so stupid for not getting that job”, and instead think, “Would I say that to my best friend?”. You probably wouldn’t. Tell yourself something positive instead, such as: “You’re a bright person, you’ll get the next job”. When times are hard, it’s tempting to drink alcohol because it “numbs” painful feelings. But it can exaggerate some feelings and make you feel angry or aggressive. It can also make you feel more depressed. Read more about the effects of alcohol on your health and get simple tips to help you cut down. Making healthy choices about your diet can make you feel emotionally stronger. You’re doing something positive for yourself, which lifts your self-esteem. A good diet helps your brain and body work efficiently, too. Aim to have a balanced diet that includes all the main food groups. Even moderate exercise releases chemicals in your brain that lift your mood. It can help you sleep better, have more energy and keep your heart healthy. Choose an exercise that you enjoy. If it helps, do it with a friend or listen to music. Adults should aim for 150 minutes a week. Around 7 to 8 hours is the average amount of sleep an adult needs for their body and mind to fully rest. Writing a “to do” list for the next day before bed can organise your thoughts and clear your mind of any distractions. Communication is important, whether it’s with a friend, family member or counsellor. Talking things through helps you to release tension, rather than keeping it inside. It helps strengthen your relationships and connect with people. Lots of people find talking to a counsellor about things that are troubling them very helpful. See benefits of talking therapy for more information. If you want to talk anonymously or urgently, you can call the Samaritans 24 hours a day on 116 123. Resilience is what allows you to cope with life’s ups and downs. Making something worthwhile out of painful times helps your resilience grow. Starting a support group to help others, or making something creative out of bad experiences by, for example, writing, painting or singing, can help you express pain and get through hard times.

      "Implement these simple tips to find joy. It’s perfectly normal to feel down, or as though you’re not the most joyful version of yourself. In these moments, and in life in general, you might find yourself wondering how to be happy.  “Happiness is not about the absence of negative emotion and the abundance of positive ones; it is about pursuing a life of meaning and purpose and living in accordance with your values,” explains Judy Ho, Ph.D., a clinical neuropsychologist in Manhattan Beach, CA. “When you do this, you will inevitably come across both highs and lows emotionally, but all lead to a deeper sense of joy.” So while happiness may look different to everybody, there are a number of changes and habits (big and small) that can lead you to a more joyful path.  Creating new habits and routines can be difficult, “But often simple lifestyle changes can have a profound influence on our mental health,” explains Joshua Hicks, Ph.D., professor, department of psychological and brain sciences, Texas A&M University. That’s why we’ve crafted a list of simple habits that will increase your levels of joy and fulfillment.  Ahead, find expert-backed tips to help you lead a fuller, more content life. Who knows, you just might find out more about yourself in the process. While it might seem like happiness feeds gratitude, it actually works the other way too. Practicing gratitude “can lead to people feeling more positive emotions and feeling an increase in motivation to engage in their life and make healthy choices,” explains Sari Chait, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist based in MA. Chait suggests maintaining a gratitude journal where you can jot down things both big and small that you feel grateful for. Starting a “mind-body morning routine” can go a long way toward setting you up for success each day and crafting an overall more positive mindset, Ho explains. Some morning routine ideas include a stretching routine, reading an inspirational quote, and setting your intentions for the day.  Ho suggests making a “joy list,” or creating a list of activities that bring you joy and committing yourself to doing one of those activities every day. By having a dedicated list of things that make you happy (like going for a walk or visiting your favorite coffee shop), you will always have something to fall back on as a pick-me-up on a bad day or something to begin each day with a more positive outlook. We know that exercise is good for our bodies, but did you know it’s also good for our mind? “Research has consistently shown that exercise helps improve mental health,” Chait explains. “Exercise leads to a release of endorphins which affect mood, and regular exercise can lead to a sense of success and to an improved self-confidence.” Try going for a long walk, dancing in your bedroom, or a yoga flow. Dehydration can negatively impact your mood and cognitive processes, research finds. So while drinking enough water might not seem like a top priority, if you’re looking to be happier…it definitely should be. Feel free to switch things up with lemon water, seltzer, or tea. “Having goals and feeling a sense of accomplishment” is one of the “main factors that have been shown to contribute to happiness,” Chait says. By setting out to do something important to you and accomplishing it, you create a sense of pride that Chait says has been shown to increase happiness. These goals can be big or small—if it’s something that speaks to you, that’s what matters most. Ho suggests challenging yourself by doing what she calls “getting into flow.” When time allows, do an activity that you are both capable of but also challenges you. The activity should be fun and interesting, as opposed to something where you may seek external validation or reward. Think: a challenging yoga pose or learning to knit. Making a plan each day will help you in terms of “understanding what you are doing and why you are doing,” Hicks says. Doing so “will make the task feel more meaningful and give you more motivation to pursue your daily goals,” in turn creating a sense of pride and accomplishment. One of the best ways to ensure personal growth is to check in with your values. Identifying your top values and evaluating if you are honoring them helps provide clarity to your day-to-day and allows you to connect with yourself. These are not things you can check off like goals, but ideas that you believe in and contribute to your character, like integrity and spirituality.  If you have trouble making decisions, you may feel unsettled or unclear on your life path or day-to-day routine. “Values-based decision making” can help, Ho says. Whenever you feel you are up against two decisions, ask yourself which choice honors your values (like the ones you identified above) more.   Personal growth and maintaining healthy habits take work—and it’s perfectly fine to fall short sometimes. “Cut yourself some slack when you fail,” Hicks says. “Try not to ruminate over lapses of self-control. As long as you commit to practicing it you will get better.” Try reciting some positive affirmations as a way to ensure you stay kind to yourself while on a path toward happiness. Deep breathing is a great way to reduce stress and center yourself so that you can continue moving forward with your goals. “When you engage in deep belly breathing, you activate the parasympathetic nervous system and your body starts to relax,” Nicole Issa, Psy.D., a licensed psychologist and founder of PVD Psychological Associates previously explained in conversation about how to relieve stress. Try these mindful breathing exercises. Being outdoors can boost your happiness big time. “When we are in nature we tend to forget about ourselves and our problems,” Hicks says. “Something about this process not only helps us destress but taking a step back from our problems can sometimes help us see them in a different light.” A simple walk in the park, visiting a nearby trail, or even taking your lunch break outside can do wonders. Try out “practical mindfulness,” Ho suggests. This means doing something “present-minded with complete focus and no distractions.” It can be something simple, and ideally something you do every day—like making coffee, showering, or brushing your teeth. It’s all about being present, in the moment, and savoring it for exactly what that moment is. This type of mindfulness can help you take on the rest of your day with a calm, positive headspace. Ho also suggests trying a walking meditation, which helps you stay mindful and active at the same time. Go for either a brief or long walk, and as you walk “narrate your surroundings to yourself so that you can be focused on the environment and what’s going on, noticing the little details as opposed to being lost in your thoughts,” Ho explains. Going to therapy is often one of the best things a person can do for their overall wellness. “If you find that you can’t get out of your rut, committing to see a professional is a great option,” Hicks says. “Sometimes it just takes advice from an expert to give us insight and get us back on the right track.” The relationships we have with others have an extreme impact on our emotional health and happiness. In fact, Hicks emphasizes making connecting with friends and loved ones a top priority. “A simple positive interaction with another human being does wonders for our mental health and well-being.” A cup of coffee with an old friend, a catch-up session over video, or putting yourself out there by making new friends in your community are all things you can do to reap those social benefits. Connecting with others is crucial, but connecting with ourselves is another important aspect of social wellness. Solitude is a “biological need,” one study reveals. It “supports identity development as well as intimacy with others” and even “promotes happiness.” So feel free to take the time you need to recharge your social battery and reconnect with yourself. Boundaries are key for establishing healthy relationships—which are the only kinds of relationships you should accept on your journey toward a happier you. The first step toward setting healthy boundaries is to acknowledge when you’re doing too much for others and not enough for yourself, as well as “learning to say no,” as explained in our 14-Day Happiness Challenge. Finding a new hobby is a great way to connect with yourself and meet new people. “Hobbies help us relax and help mitigate boredom and other things that are antithetical to happiness,” Hicks explains. “Interacting with people who make us feel authentic is very important for our experience of meaningfulness.” The reward we get from helping others through volunteering often leads to an increase in happiness. “Helping someone else leads to increased positive emotions,” Chait explains. “Volunteering also often includes some amount of social interactions which has been shown to be a strong contributor to happiness.” It also offers the opportunity to try new things—like working with animals or children and offers the opportunity to learn new skills.

Here's some of the best research that we've found on personal happiness. Happiness is something we think about a lot at Buffer. It's been a cornerstone of our culture from the beginning (just take a look at this slide deck about it from way back in 2013). Though our values have evolved since then, you'll still see echoes of how important it is for us to cultivate in our most up-to-date version.  No surprises then that I thought it would be interesting to dig into the research on how to become a happier person. Spoiler: there's a lot of it! After combing through as much as I could, here are 11 of the simplest ways I uncovered to be happy today, according to science. You've likely heard of endorphins, the pain and stress-relieving hormones released when you exercise. But the release of these feel-good chemicals is not the only dramatic effect that exercise can have on your body. Getting moving also triggers the release of more happiness hormones, serotonin and dopamine. On top of that, exercise increases your heart rate, which in turn pumps more oxygen to your brain. A well-oxygenated brain is as great as it sounds — many studies have found that this can help manage anxiety and depression, too. In Shawn Achor’s book, The Happiness Advantage, he cites a fascinating study on this. (The book is a great read by the way — I'll be referring back to it a lot in this article!). In the study, three groups of patients treated their depression with either medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. The results of this study surprised me. Although all three groups experienced similar improvements in their happiness levels to begin with, the follow-up assessments proved to be radically different: \"The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate,\" Achor writes. \"Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent.\" Exercise can help you to relax, increase your brain power, and improve your body image. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology found that people who exercised felt better about their bodies, even when they saw no physical changes. The best part? This doesn’t mean you need to commit to a miles-long run or strenuous HIIT class every day to have a happy life — just 10 minutes of movement a day has been proven to be enough to boost happiness levels, according to The Journal of Happiness Studies. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), sleep deprivation dramatically impairs memory and concentration, disrupts your metabolism, and increases levels of stress hormones.  Beyond the severe physical consequences of getting enough sleep (“People who chronically fail to get enough sleep may actually be cutting their lives short,” the APA says), you don’t need me to tell you that a bad night’s sleep can seriously impact your mood.  A study published in the journal Sleep, which analyzed the sleep patterns of 30,594 people over the age of 16 in the U.K. across a period of 4 years, found that insufficient or poor sleep worsened emotional states.  With the widely used General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a survey that helps determine health-related quality of life, they made some interesting comparisons with participants who got more and better sleep:  “Changes on the GHQ are comparable with those seen in mental health professionals completing an eight-week program of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy designed to improve psychological well-being,” researchers write.  “They are also comparable with the average improvement in well-being shown by U.K. lottery winners two years after a medium-sized lottery win.” Read: Getting more sleep will boost your mood as much as winning the lottery.  Our commute to the office can have a powerful impact on our happiness. The fact that we tend to do this twice a day, five days a week, makes it unsurprising that its effect would build up over time and make us less and less happy. Several studies have found that happiness and commute time are inversely proportional. As this paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health put it: “The longer the commute, the lower the satisfaction with work and life; the length of commuting can also cause damage to health, affecting physical health and causing inactivity.” Little wonder then that a commute that is a matter of seconds — i.e. the distance between your bedroom/kitchen/bathroom and your desk — is a huge factor in happiness and well-being. A 2023 study by Tracking Happiness found that remote workers are 20% happier than their in-office counterparts. In our most recent State of Remote Work report, 91 percent of respondents had had a positive experience of working remotely, while 98 percent said they would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Social time is highly valuable when it comes to improving our happiness, even for introverts. Several studies have found that time spent with friends and family makes a big difference to how happy we feel, generally. I love the way Harvard happiness expert Daniel Gilbert explains it: “We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends, and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.” Psychiatrist George Vaillant is the director of a 72-year study of the lives of 268 men, one of the most comprehensive longitudinal studies in history. In an interview in 2008, he was asked about what he'd learned from the men. Vaillant’s response: \"That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.\" He shared insights of the study with The Atlantic's Joshua Wolf Shenk on how the men’s social connections made a difference to their overall happiness: “The men’s relationships at age 47, he found, predicted late-life adjustment better than any other variable, except defenses,\" Wolf Shenk writes. \"Good sibling relationships seem especially powerful: 93 percent of the men who were thriving at age 65 had been close to a brother or sister when younger.\" Great news for those of us who spend most of our days at our desks: you don't need to spend hours in the sunshine to reap the benefits of good old-fashioned fresh air. Spending time outdoors in a green space for just 20 minutes was enough to boost well-being, according to a study in the International Journal of Environmental Health Research. “Some people may go to the park and just enjoy nature,\" study co-author Hon Yuen told TIME. \"It’s not that they have to be rigorous in terms of exercise. You relax and reduce stress, and then you feel more happy.” If the idea of finding a space green enough to be considered 'nature' feels a bit far off, fear not — the study had participants visit urban parks in Birmingham, U.K., not Yosemite.  A study from the University of Sussex also found that being outdoors might contribute towards a happier life: “Being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, participants were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all-natural environments than they were in urban environments.” Interestingly, temperature can play a role, too. The American Meteorological Society published research that found current temperature has a bigger effect on our happiness than variables like wind speed and humidity, or even the average temperature over the course of a day. It also found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C (57°F), so keep an eye on the weather forecast before heading outside for your 20 minutes of fresh air. There are plenty of studies that show volunteering, random acts of kindness, or just giving someone else a compliment can boost your mood. In his book Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being, University of Pennsylvania professor Martin Seligman explains that helping others can improve our own lives: \"We scientists have found that doing a kindness produces the single most reliable momentary increase in well-being of any exercise we have tested.\" If we go back to Shawn Achor’s book, he says this about helping others: \"When researchers interviewed more than 150 people about their recent purchases, they found that money spent on activities — such as concerts and group dinners out — brought far more pleasure than material purchases like shoes, televisions, or expensive watches. Spending money on other people, called 'prosocial spending', also boosts happiness.\" Giving time, rather than money, is an option too: volunteering could be particularly beneficial. In a paper in the Journal of Happiness Studies, researchers examined data from nearly 70,000 subjects in the U.K. They found that people who had volunteered in the past year were more satisfied with their lives and rated their overall health as better.  They also discovered that volunteering more frequently meant greater benefits. Those who volunteered at least once a month reported better mental health than those who helped out irregularly or not at all.  Fun fact: The simple act of smiling causes the brain to release those feel-good hormones dopamine and serotonin.  Smiling itself can make us feel better, but it’s more effective when we back it up with positive thoughts, according to this study published in the Academy of Management Journal: “Customer-service workers who fake smiles throughout the day worsen their mood and withdraw from work, affecting productivity. But workers who smile as a result of cultivating positive thoughts — such as a tropical vacation or a child’s recital — improve their mood and withdraw less.” One of our previous posts goes into even more detail about the science of smiling. As opposed to actually taking a holiday, planning a vacation or just a break from work can improve our happiness. A study published in the journal Applied Research in Quality of Life showed that the highest spike in happiness came during the planning stage of a vacation as employees enjoyed a sense of anticipation, which boosted happiness for eight weeks. After the vacation, happiness quickly dropped back to baseline levels for most people. If you can’t take the time for a vacation right now, or even a night out with friends, put something on the calendar — even if it’s a month or a year down the road. Then whenever you need a boost of happiness, remind yourself about it. Meditation is often touted as an important habit for improving focus, clarity, and attention span, as well as helping to keep you calm. It turns out it’s also useful for improving your happiness. A study by Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation.  After the course, they scanned participants' brains again — and found that the parts of their brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank. According to Shawn Achor, meditation can make you happier long-term: “Studies show that in the minutes right after meditating, we experience feelings of calm and contentment, as well as heightened awareness and empathy. And, research even shows that regular meditation can permanently rewire the brain to raise levels of happiness.” If sitting down to meditate feels a bit intimidating, the simple act of taking a few deep breaths can work wonders. A study in Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, (titled ‘How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life’), found that deep breathing can reduce stress and increase emotional control.  Focusing on the breath is also a useful grounding practice in meditation and a great place to start. This is a seemingly simple strategy, but I’ve personally found it to make a huge difference to my outlook.  There are lots of ways to practice gratitude, from keeping a journal of things you’re grateful for, sharing three good things that happen each day with a friend or your partner, and going out of your way to show gratitude when others help you. In an experiment where some participants took note of things they were grateful for each day, their moods were improved just from this simple practice. Participants \"exhibited heightened well-being across several, though not all, of the outcome measures across the three studies, relative to the comparison groups,\" the authors of the study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology write. \"The effect on positive affect appeared to be the most robust finding. Results suggest that a conscious focus on blessings may have emotional and interpersonal benefits.\" The Journal of Happiness Studies published a paper that used letters of gratitude to test how being grateful can affect our levels of happiness. Participants included 219 men and women who wrote three letters of gratitude over a three-week period. \"Results indicated that writing letters of gratitude increased participants’ happiness and life satisfaction while decreasing depressive symptoms.\" Gratitude is still one of Buffer’s core values and something Bufferoos try to practice in their day-to-day work. A simple way we express gratitude to our coworkers every day is through our ‘#culture-gratitude’ channel in Slack, where we share when someone goes above and beyond in their work (which is pretty often).  Here’s a recent message from Maria, our Chief Product Officer, about Content Writer Tami: In an article for Psychology Today, Paula Davis J.D., M.A.P.P (who has a Master’s degree in positive psychology) writes that when it comes to happiness-boosting activities, one size does not fit all. “You tailor your workout to your specific fitness goals — happy people do the same thing with their emotional goals,” she says. “Some strategies that are known to promote happiness are just too corny for me, but the ones that work best allow me to practice acts of kindness, express gratitude, and become fully engaged.” A bonus point you didn't ask for: it’s interesting to note that as we get older, particularly past middle age, we tend to grow happier naturally. There’s still some debate over why this happens, but scientists have got a few ideas. According to this article in Perspectives on Psychological Science, researchers write: \"Older people shown pictures of faces or situations tend to focus on and remember the happier ones more and the negative ones less. Other studies have discovered that as people age, they seek out situations that will lift their moods — for instance, pruning social circles of friends or acquaintances who might bring them down.  \"Still other work finds that older adults learn to let go of loss and disappointment over unachieved goals, and hew their goals toward greater wellbeing.\" So if you thought being old would make you miserable, rest assured that it’s likely you’ll develop a more positive outlook than you probably have now.  140,000+ small businesses like yours use Buffer to build their brand on social media every month Personal brand experts walked this writer through exactly how to switch up her personal brand — and offered some more general advice, too.

      "Becoming Minimalist Own less. Live more. Finding minimalism in a world of consumerism. Written by joshua becker · 55 Comments  Last updated: May 1, 2022  Happiness is a state of mind. Specifically, it is a state of “well-being and contentment.”  But the definition can be tricky and assumptions about the word can cause confusion. Many don’t even realize learning how to be happy is something that can be intentionally practiced. Some people, when they hear the word ‘happiness,’ assume it is speaking of an emotion such as pleasure or joy. For them, it is what people feel in the immediate here and now. This is the reason some people say, “Don’t pursue happiness, seek joy. Happiness is fickle and fading, joy remains forever.” But this short-term definition of happiness is not how everyone understands the word. Some define it to mean long-term satisfaction.  In fact, when I speak of experiencing happiness in life, I am not thinking of short-term emotions at all. I think of a quality of living—a much longer-term view of the word. Both definitions are understood to be correct and speak of different realities. But are they really that different? I don’t think so.  After all, a long-term experience of life satisfaction is almost certainly made up of many short-term feelings of joy and pleasure. Does that mean every day is a great day with no trials, temptations, or downturns? Certainly not. But it does mean when we look back at the many seasons of life, we can look back satisfied at how we navigated them. The long-term feeling of life satisfaction is most experienced when we embrace the emotion of joy in the here and now. And we accomplish that by taking steps each day to be happy. Here are some tips on how to be happier starting today. The most important thing to realize about happiness is that it is not an outcome of current circumstances. Just the opposite, happiness is a choice. Is this easier on some days than others? Absolutely. But if you get caught in the trap of thinking your circumstances need to change before you can be happy, you’ll never, ever get there.  There are good things in your life right now: you are alive, you are fed, you are healthy, you have family and friends, and you have opportunities each day to pursue meaningful work. Maybe not all of those are true for you right now, but certainly some of them are—which means there is good in your life that you can focus on.  Marine Sgt. Jonny Joseph Jones lost both of his legs in an explosion while serving in Afghanistan. I was struck by a quote of his I saw recently. He said  this, “People ask how I stay so positive after losing my legs… I simply ask how they stay so negative when they have both of theirs.”  Happiness is about perspective and if you’re looking for reasons to be happy, you’ll probably find them. Happy people focus on positive thoughts. No matter how you choose to define happiness—short-term or long-term—comparison will rob you of it. Whether we compare our finances, our body type, our vacations, our talents, our house size or our shoe size, there are no winners in the game of comparison. But here’s the good news: Nobody is forcing you to play! You can stop any time you want. Be grateful for what you have, appreciate who you are, work hard every day to live your best life, and stop comparing yourself to others. In the world of positive psychology, there are a few themes that emerge every time happiness is studied. Among those recurring themes, we find gratitude and generosity.  Both of which can only be understood correctly when we see them as disciplines rather than responses. A discipline is something we practice regardless of our circumstances. If you are waiting for enough money to become generous, you’ll never get there. Likewise, if you are waiting for everything to be perfect to be grateful, you’ll never experience it. Choose to be thankful today. And choose to be generous with your time and money. Making them both a discipline in your life will result in a happier today… and tomorrow.  Possessions are necessary for life, but our society has seemed to confuse consumerism with happiness. Marketers work hard to convince us their products are not just needed for life, but that they are essential for happiness.  Slowly but surely, we begin to believe their empty promises and waste our lives pursuing things that can never satisfy. We sacrifice time, money, energy, and focus chasing and accumulating things we do not need.  These excess possessions add stress, worry, and burden onto our lives. Want to become a bit more happy today? Go declutter a closet or drawer and start to challenge consumerism in your life.  Robert J. Waldinger is an American psychiatrist and Professor at Harvard Medical School where he is best known for directing the world’s longest-running longitudinal study tracking the health and mental well-being of a group of 724 American men for 76 years. One thing that he has learned, and has been confirmed by studies elsewhere, is that relationships hold the key to happiness:  Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes. We don’t get to control every aspect of our relationships (we didn’t choose our family, for example). But we can all take steps to be a good friend. And good friends tend to attract healthy community. Annie Dillard is credited for saying, “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” And she is right. Our lives are filled with days, our days are filled with hours, and this present hour is filled with whatever you chose to fill it with. So pursue healthy habits that add value to your hours, days, and lifetime. Spend time outside. Eat healthy. Exercise regularly. Quit smoking. Put down your cell phone. Obsess less. Work hard. Pray often. And get enough sleep. The pursuit of self comes natural to us. We don’t need to be reminded to pursue our own self-interests. We pursue self-survival, self-promotion, self-actualization, and self-exaltation as if it is hardwired in our genes. But the most efficient pathway to lasting happiness and fulfillment is not to look only at your own interests, but also to the interests of others. When we shift our focus off of ourselves, we live lives of greater meaning and greater contribution. When we serve others without concern over what we might receive in return, we experience the beauty of selfless love. The size of our universe (and happiness) begins to expand exponentially. It is no small thing that happiness is pursued by so many. Let’s make sure we find it—in both the short term and the long term. \n",

      "the real problem is that most of people like myself, know these thing and are even doing them but still we are nit happy.\n",
      "maybe in a world like this these things does not work anymore.\n",

      "Mardi Lynn says  March 17, 2023 at 2:54 PM The article doesn’t mention the importance of having a passion and purpose in life and a spiritual connection with the Creator that endowed you with unique gifts to share with the world. I think these might be the missing pieces for you Mojtaba When you have these foundational elements, all the other elements of happiness fall into place. \n",

      "We aren’t stupid, we know the theory of what anyone can do to be happy, actually living happy isn’t something that comes naturally or easily to some of us. We do the things in the article, and many more as well, but sometimes, happiness alludes us. I’ve struggled for 60 years to be happy. I’ve had therapy, medication, spiritual mindfulness, and much more. Where some people have moments of being low or miserable, I have moments of happiness in an otherwise depressive life. Just ‘choosing’ to be happy isn’t a solution. If choosing to be happy worked, I’d be the happiest person on earth! I choose happy, but it’s so hard to feel it. One of the biggest problems is that society, all the happy and non-depressive, non-anxious people, are always telling us that people who don’t feel the way they do need to be ‘fixed’. People like me don’t go around telling you it’s not good to be so happy and so positive, yet you all feel justified in telling us we shouldn’t be the way we are. You were born they way you are, we were born the way we are. You don’t struggle to be happy, calm, confident, positive; we struggle everyday to be everything. We are trying hard every day, we don’t need to be patronised with advice like ‘choose happiness!’ \n",
      "Matthew James says  June 13, 2023 at 9:11 AM I think this response is exactly what he is talking about. You are making a choice to be happy. If you never had any desire, you probably wouldn’t be happy. Also, he talks about being independent when it comes to you’re happiness. You’re circumstances dont determine happiness, you do! You read this whole message and chose to be offended. I read this and got very excited because somebody is trying to help others and seems to know what they are talking about. It seems like you are blaming YOU’RE problems on other people. “He caused this, she caused this, society is the problem.” Did society force you to feel that way? Did this author make you feel this way? No, you are the cause of you’re pain.\n",
      "Also, he was basing all of his points in evidence, like studies. Maybe faith and religion just did come to mind or doesn’t have much reliable info. Maybe faith does have a big part to play in happiness, but he just didn’t have it here.\n",
      "If someone trying to help triggers you so much, have you truly been happy for 60 years? This question is not for me. Maybe you have some insecurity about you’re happiness, or you are insecure about you’re faith. “If they dont include me/my beliefs, they are wrong and the problem.” Maybe other people are not to blame for all you’re pain, and thats a good thing. If its youre thoughts causing youre pain, GREAT! You can change it! I think the author did fantastic! I have been preaching that happiness is a long term thing composed of joy and contentment, and he said it too! In fact my girlfriend hears me say it so often I sent her a screenshot this article saying it. Im glad to finally find a page where it seems the writer truly understands what it means to be happy \n",
      "Sakshi says  February 19, 2023 at 9:29 PM This post is a great reminder that happiness is not something that can be bought or achieved through external means, but rather a state of mind that we can cultivate through intentional actions and attitudes. \n",

      "This page was last updated November 2023. If you want to do as much good as possible with the resources you have, here is one real-life choice you face. For about $6,000 you could: Which option will do the most good? This is a challenging question – how can we possibly compare saving lives, reducing poverty, and treating mental illness? At the Happier Lives Institute, we believe it’s possible to answer this question by comparing the effects on people’s subjective wellbeing (self-reports of happiness and life satisfaction). What’s more, taking this approach leads to some surprising results. The following sections introduce the key ideas and guiding principles that define our approach. Throughout, you’ll find many links to our growing list of research reports as well as the academic literature we draw on. We begin with a general overview before expanding on each idea in greater depth. We think that wellbeing is how people feel during or about their lives i.e. how happy or satisfied they are. When we talk about doing good, what most of us really have in mind is improving people’s wellbeing. But what is ‘wellbeing’? We believe that it is people’s subjective wellbeing that we should ultimately care about. Health and wealth aren’t important in themselves, they only matter because they improve our subjective wellbeing. Even if you think that happiness or life satisfaction are not the only things that matter, you will probably still care about them to some extent. Subjective wellbeing can be measured in a scientifically valid and reliable way through self-reports. Social scientists have been doing large-scale population surveys since the 1960s. A typical question is “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? (0-10)” Some people are very sceptical about putting numbers on feelings but we don’t think their objections are serious enough to give up on happiness surveys. If we want to know how people’s lives are going, we need to ask them.  Measuring and increasing happiness across society is a very old idea that was briefly abandoned and is now returning. Many ancient philosophers and Enlightenment thinkers understood happiness as the goal of life. But in the early 20th-century, the rise of behaviourism amongst economists and psychologists led to scepticism that we could or should measure feelings and we started using objective measures of social progress instead, such as GDP.  In recent years, there has been a resurgence in support for a wellbeing approach amongst academics, policymakers, and civil society that is now gathering force. For the first time in human history, we can identify the best ways to improve global happiness in a scientifically rigorous way. Due to the rapidly increasing amount of wellbeing research conducted in recent decades, we now have a much better idea of the factors that have the biggest impact on subjective wellbeing. However, this work has barely begun and we don’t think anyone can confidently say what the top priorities are yet.  Current global priorities may change significantly if we adopt a subjective wellbeing approach. Of course, policymakers and philanthropists have already done a lot of thinking about how they can best use their resources to improve people’s lives.  After all, haven’t we often made decisions with people’s happiness and life satisfaction in mind, even if we haven’t directly measured those things? Unfortunately, psychological research shows that we make predictable mistakes when thinking about what makes us, and others, happy. In broad terms, we place too much importance on what we can see objectively, such as wealth and physical health, and overlook people’s emotional and social lives. The Happier Lives Institute was founded in 2019 to find the most cost-effective ways to make lives happier. We currently focus on identifying high-impact funding opportunities in low-income countries because we expect that’s where money will go furthest. Our most thorough evaluation so far looks at the cost-effectiveness of providing psychotherapy for people living with depression compared to providing $1,000 cash transfers to very poor families. We estimate that psychotherapy is 9 times more cost-effective – the effect of therapy is slightly larger and it is much cheaper to provide. This challenges existing thinking about how to do the most good and suggests that treating mental health conditions should be a higher priority for decision-makers.   More research is needed to work out what the priorities should be. Mental health could turn out to be the most pressing global problem, but we may find other problems that are even more important. In the near future, we plan to evaluate a wide range of interventions including deworming programmes, cataract surgery, lead regulation, immigration policy, and access to pain relief. There are also some thorny philosophical issues related to the nature and measurement of wellbeing that need further thought, including how to compare saving lives to improving lives. Our vision is a world where everyone lives their happiest life. We want to see a world where governments and philanthropists base their decisions, at least in part, on the best wellbeing evidence. If you think that making people happier sounds like a good idea, we encourage you to do what you can to make this happen. At the end of this article, we provide advice for donors, researchers, entrepreneurs, advocates, and policymakers. The claim that subjective wellbeing matters morally may seem to require no defence. But let’s put these ideas in their full theoretical context. In this section, we explain what wellbeing is, summarise the three philosophical theories of wellbeing, and introduce the three measures of subjective wellbeing that relate to each theory. In philosophy, wellbeing refers to what is intrinsically (or non-instrumentally) good for someone. Instrumental goods, like wealth, are only valuable as a means to something else, whereas wellbeing is what ultimately makes someone’s life go well. Understanding what makes life go well is of obvious value: every plausible ethical view holds that wellbeing matters in principle, and in practice, we do put great effort into improving the wellbeing of ourselves and others. Theories of wellbeing are generally divided into three families: hedonism, desire-fulfilment, and the objective list. The following sections provide a brief summary of each.  Learn more: The philosophy of wellbeing  Hedonists claim that wellbeing consists in an overall positive balance of pleasure over pain. In other words, what is good for you is whatever feels good to you. It seems implausible that something you haven’t experienced directly could make a difference to your wellbeing. If you never feel its impact, how could it affect your life?  The most well-known objection to hedonism is the ‘experience machine’ (Nozick, 1974). Imagine that you are offered the opportunity to spend the rest of your life inside a virtual reality capable of simulating any experience. Once plugged in, you could indulge in any number of pleasurable or happy experiences without ever wishing or even knowing you had left the real world. Hedonists think that plugging into the experience machine would make your life go better. But many people would reject the prospect of leaving behind the real world for a simulated existence, however pleasurable. This is often because they desire to do things in the ‘real’ world and the mere experience of (apparently) doing them is no substitute for in fact doing them. This leads us to the second family of theories. Desire-fulfilment (or preference satisfaction) theories claim that it is the fulfilment of a person’s desires that makes their life go well. It is not the feeling or experience of a desire being satisfied that matters but that the desire is, in fact, satisfied. You want to actually climb Everest, rather than merely believe that you have. If you only wanted to feel satisfied, your view would also be vulnerable to the experience machine objection.  A general objection to this family of theories is that the objects of desire (friendships, success, happiness etc.) are not valuable because they are desired. Instead, they are desired because they are valuable, and so desire theories have got the explanation the wrong way around. Plant (2020) notes that desire-fulfilment theories are also vulnerable to ‘auto-maximisation’. This means that you can make your life better by simply choosing desires that are trivially easy to fulfil. For example, if your only desire is that Paris is the capital of France, hey presto, your life goes best. There also seems to be no way for these theories to apply to animals that lack desires about how their lives go overall, such as dogs, who we tend to think do have wellbeing. Learn more: A critique of desire-fulfilment theories  Watch: Michael Plant presents the critique at the Wellbeing Research Centre Objective list theories claim there are some things that improve your life that may be neither pleasurable nor desired by you. Classic items for this list include success, friendship, knowledge, virtuous behaviour, and health. Such items are ‘objective’ in the sense of being concerned with facts beyond both a person’s conscious experience and/or their desires.  Defenders of objective list theories might object to the previous two theories as naively simplistic – wellbeing cannot be reduced to a single element, life is far more complicated than that. Yet, pluralism, the view that more than one thing makes up wellbeing, faces its own challenges. If the items have a characteristic feature in common then you should replace the list with that single feature. If not, then how should you make trade-offs between the different items on the list? Whichever theory you think is true, happiness and life satisfaction will play some role. For hedonists, happiness is all that matters. On desire theories, life satisfaction – how your life goes compared to how you desire it to go – is central and happiness matters because it is something we desire. If you favour the objective list, it would be odd if neither happiness nor life satisfaction were on it. Therefore, it’s not particularly controversial to claim that subjective wellbeing is something we care about. The more controversial claim, which we’ll come to later, is that we can measure psychological states through self-reports in a scientifically valid and reliable way Even if you agree that subjective wellbeing matters, there are still questions about which theory of wellbeing is correct and determining the extent of practical disagreement between these theories is a further empirical challenge. The good news is that uncertainty about the correct theory of wellbeing does not prevent us from reaching some understanding of how to improve wellbeing in practice. This is because the three theories of wellbeing often agree on the things that lead to wellbeing: the person who is happy, successful, wise, and loved will have high wellbeing on all plausible theories. Nevertheless, the extent to which different theories of wellbeing suggest different priorities in practice remains an open question requiring further research. Subjective wellbeing (SWB) is an umbrella term for self-reported ratings of thoughts and feelings about life which fall into three main categories: hedonic, cognitive, and eudaimonic. SWB and happiness are often used interchangeably but SWB is a broader concept incorporating overall evaluations of life as well as momentary experiences of happiness. In the following sections, we describe each of these three categories in more detail and explain how they are measured. We leave discussion of why we think such measures are scientifically valid for Section 2. All sensations can be placed on a single scale of ‘pleasantness’ and we define happiness as a net balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience.  Using hedonic measures, the only two components of happiness are intensity (how pleasant/unpleasant something feels) and duration (how long the sensation lasts). Hedonic measures are sometimes split into positive affect and negative affect, which can each be measured separately and have different determinants. The former refers to pleasant emotions such as joy, contentment, and elation; the latter to unpleasant emotions such as sadness, fear, and anxiety.  Affect data is commonly collected using questionnaires based on PANAS and SPANE scales. Another measure is the day reconstruction method (DRM) in which participants break their previous day into episodes (like scenes in a movie) and state, for each episode, what they were doing, how they felt, and who they were with. A more accurate, but less common measure, is the experience sampling method (ESM) where participants are prompted, one or more times a day, to record how they are feeling at that particular moment. Although costly to implement, ESM avoids the problem of asking participants to remember how they felt. This is a significant benefit, given how error-prone our memories can be. Cognitive measures of wellbeing are based on the view that happiness consists in having a favourable attitude towards one’s life as a whole. Life satisfaction is usually found by asking, “how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?” on a scale from 0 “not at all” to 10 “completely”.  Most of the SWB literature has focussed on measures of life satisfaction up to now and there are two main reasons for this.  The first is practical. It is much easier to collect data on life evaluations than on experiences. Participants usually answer questions about life satisfaction in less than 30 seconds and it can easily be included in existing population surveys. By comparison, the ESM and DRM require more work from respondents; the former is intrusive and the latter takes respondents about 40 minutes to complete. Affect data from PANAS and SPANE questionnaires are strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation is weaker for data collected using the ESM or DRM methods.  The second reason is moral. Life evaluations are sometimes thought by economists to be a measure of decision utility (what people choose to do). Economists have historically taken this to be of greater moral importance than experienced utility (how life is experienced). Learn more: A critique of life satisfaction measures Watch: Michael Plant presents the critique at the Wellbeing Research Centre Eudaimonic measures seek to quantify traits like virtue, character, and wisdom as well as concepts related to fulfilling our potential such as meaning, purpose, and flourishing. Eudaimonic measures are often regarded as a core component of SWB, particularly in the field of positive psychology. However, it is unclear whether measures of meaning are really measures of wellbeing and little data has been collected on them. Perhaps you are sceptical of the claim that we can measure subjective concepts like happiness. However, the last few decades have seen an explosion of research on subjective wellbeing as social scientists and policymakers grow increasingly confident in the validity of these measures. This section provides a range of evidence that we hope will go some way to alleviating your concerns.  Before we begin, let’s introduce two key concepts: reliability and validity. A measure is reliable if it gives the same results each time (assuming the subject of measurement hasn’t changed). A measure that gave a random score each time would not be measuring anything. A measure is valid if it captures the underlying phenomenon it set out to capture. Let’s discuss each concept in turn. Learn more: The measurement of wellbeing  A range of statistical tests has been conducted to confirm the reliability of subjective wellbeing measures. We quote here from the OECD Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being (2013). On hedonic measures:  “Diener et al. (2009) report…the positive, negative, and affective balance subscales of their Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) have alphas of 0.84, 0.88, and 0.88 respectively. Krueger and Schkade (2008) report test-retest correlations of 0.5 and 0.7 for a range of different measures of affect over a two-week period.” On cognitive measures:  “Test-retest results for a single-item life evaluation measure tend to yield correlations of between 0.5 and 0.7 for a time period of 1 day to 2 weeks (Krueger and Schkade, 2008). Michalos and Kahlke (2010) report that a single-item measure of life satisfaction had a correlation of 0.65 for a one-year period and 0.65 for a two-year period.” Subjective wellbeing measures have also been subjected to a range of validation tests. The main test is construct validity – whether the measure performs in the world the way that theory predicts. Socialising, relaxing, and eating are associated with higher levels of positive affect, while commuting, working, and housework are associated with low levels of positive affect (Kahneman et al., 2009). Higher incomes are associated with higher life satisfaction and affect (up to a certain point) all around the world, at both the individual and country level (Stevenson & Wolfers, 2013). Stable, wealthy, well-governed countries score highly on average life satisfaction (Finland, Denmark, and Norway average around 7.5/10). On the other hand, war-torn and low-income countries do badly: South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Afghanistan average about 3/10 (World Happiness Report, 2021).  Hedonic and evaluative measures relate to different aspects of wellbeing so we shouldn’t expect them to give the same results all the time. For example, Deaton and Stone (2013) found that affect measures vary on the days of the week, improve with age, and only respond to income up to a point whereas evaluative measures correlate with income (even at high levels of income), are often U-shaped in relation to age, and do not vary over the days of the week. However, for practical purposes, affect and life satisfaction measures generally go together so we can use the latter as a substitute for the former. However, some caution is still needed as the measures differ in the degree to which different things matter and sometimes whether those things are positive or negative. A long-standing worry about subjective wellbeing measures is whether the numbers represent the same thing to different people at different times (Ferrer-i-Carbonell & Frijters, 2004). For example, if two people say they are 5/10 happy, can we assume they are as happy as each other? More technically, the question is whether subjective scales are cardinally comparable – does a one-point change represent the same size change at all points of the scale?  If the scales are merely ordinal (the numbers represent a ranking but contain no information on the relative magnitudes of differences), it will not be possible to use subjective scales to determine the best ways to increase global wellbeing.  The image below is taken from a 2018 survey by YouGov which asked people to score different words on a 0-10 scale from very negative to very positive. The results demonstrate that people tend to score positive and negative words in very similar ways which should increase our confidence in people’s ability to assign numbers to their subjective feelings in a meaningful and consistent way.  Learn more: The cardinality of subjective wellbeing scales  Watch: Michael Plant presents at a workshop on wellbeing measurement Even if subjective wellbeing measures are generally good, it doesn’t mean they are flawless. But the fact there are some measurement issues is not sufficient to declare the scales invalid. If your bathroom scales give you an implausible result, you wouldn’t conclude that measuring weight is impossible. Much has been made of studies that find seemingly irrelevant factors can affect self-reports of wellbeing, such as finding a coin or being asked about your love life or politics just before you report your score. However, the impact of such factors is relatively limited and has not been borne out by the wider literature. Diener et al. (2013) find that 60-80% of the variability in life satisfaction is associated with long-term factors and the remainder with occasion-specific issues and measurement errors. When large populations are surveyed, random errors will wash out and such issues can also be minimised through careful survey design. Measuring and increasing happiness is not a new idea but efforts to conduct large population surveys only started a few decades ago. Why? What’s changed? In the following sections, we present a brief history of Western thinking about happiness over the last 2,500 years and highlight the current trends in wellbeing research. Aristotle used the term ‘eudaimonia’ for the ultimate goal of life. Wealth, health, and relationships were all considered to be important, but Aristotle placed particular emphasis on virtue as an essential component of a fulfilling life. Later schools of philosophy focused on specific aspects of Aristotle’s ideas. The Epicureans favoured a life based on friendship and simple pleasures whilst the Stoics emphasised the control of emotions in challenging situations. These two approaches to the good life spread throughout the Roman empire, aided by the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher. However, as monotheistic religions spread across the world over the following centuries, people came to believe that happiness would be found in the afterlife as the reward for living a virtuous life on Earth. It was not until the late 1600s that philosophers began to re-establish happiness as the goal of life, with John Locke’s claim that, “the necessity of pursuing true happiness is the foundation of all liberty”. In the 18th century, Francis Hutcheson was the first to argue that we should produce “the greatest happiness for the greatest number”, an idea that influenced many great thinkers. Thomas Jefferson wrote that “the life and happiness of the people is the first and only object of good government”, Adam Smith studied economic methods to create the greatest happiness, and Jeremy Bentham coined the term utilitarianism in his famous book, The Principle of Morals and Legislation. John Stuart Mill inspired many social reforms based on utilitarian principles and the economist Francis Edgeworth discussed the need for a ‘hedonometer’ to measure happiness. In the 20th century, the psychologists Ivan Pavlov and John B Watson claimed it was impossible to know what occurred inside people’s minds or how they felt. They argued that we could only study how people behaved and how this was affected by external stimuli. In 1932, Lionel Robbins (an economist) dismissed the idea that it was possible to compare the happiness of one person with another and argued that economists should only observe revealed behaviour, rather than attempting to measure how people feel. This turn to behaviourism led to GDP (gross domestic product) becoming the primary measure of national wellbeing in the post-war period, despite the protests of its inventor, Simon Kuznets, who said, “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income”.  Criticism of GDP as a measure of national progress has grown stronger in recent years. In 1974, Richard Easterlin showed that wellbeing in the USA had barely changed since WWII, despite significant economic growth (the so-called Easterlin Paradox). In a significant step forward for the field of wellbeing, Ed Diener and Daniel Kahneman (starting in the 1980s) showed that it was possible for wellbeing to be effectively measured and explained. Since then, psychologists and economists have made increasing use of subjective measures to investigate which experiences have the biggest effect on individual wellbeing.  The last few decades have seen an explosion of research on subjective wellbeing (SWB) with over 170,000 books and articles published in the last 15 years (see figure below). Policymakers are starting to take note too. The UK government has been measuring SWB for over a decade and, in 2013, the OECD suggested that its member-states should do the same. In 2019, New Zealand became the first country to introduce a Wellbeing Budget and joined Finland, Iceland, Scotland, and Wales to form the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership.  Learn more: Trends in conceptions of progress and well-being If subjective wellbeing measures have only come into use in recent decades, how have researchers and policymakers been measuring progress up to now? When a direct measure is unavailable, a ‘proxy measure’, one you think is a suitable stand-in, might be used instead. It is common to use income metrics (e.g. GDP per capita) or health metrics (e.g. quality-adjusted life years) as proxies for wellbeing but these suffer from a number of problems which we explain further in the following sections. Psychologists use the phrase ‘failures of affective forecasting’ to describe the mistakes we make when predicting how we, and others, will feel in the future (Gilbert & Wilson, 2007; Wilson & Gilbert, 2005; Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). We underestimate the suffering caused by problems that are resistant to hedonic adaptation (Greene, Sturm, & Evelo, 2016), as well as experiences where it is difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of others (Igou, 2008). Our mental simulations produce these errors because they are egocentric, neglect context, and poorly represent time. Mental illness and chronic pain are two of the biggest problems that are under-valued in this way (Birkjær, Kaats, & Rubio, 2020; Graham, Higuera, & Lora, 2011). Understanding the “expectation-reality gap”, the gap between what people think makes others happy and what actually does, can help us to identify and evaluate global priorities more effectively. As you’ll see in the chart from Our World in Data below, people across a range of cultures mistakenly believe that others are less happy than they really are.   Learn more: Our report on affective forecasting  As we saw in the introduction, a challenging problem arises when you are faced with a choice between two (or more) different methods for increasing wellbeing. How much ‘moral weight’ should we give to saving a life, compared to increasing income, or treating someone for depression? Many people think it is too simplistic to reduce wellbeing to a single measure so they combine metrics for income, life expectancy, literacy, and many other things into a multi-dimensional index. However, each item on the list needs to be given an appropriate weighting which means that the difficult questions about trade-offs must still be faced. However, there is a solution to this problem. By measuring subjective wellbeing, we can directly compare the impact of different interventions on the wellbeing of the recipients rather than making an educated guess about their relative impact.  Learn more: Estimating moral weights using subjective wellbeing  GDP has been a common measure of national progress since the 1950s. However, the Easterlin Paradox (Easterlin, 1974) notes that average life satisfaction in the developed world has remained broadly stable over the last few decades despite a continuous rise in GDP per capita. This can be clearly seen in the charts below which plot life satisfaction (the white dots) against GDP per capita (the red line) in four high-income countries over recent decades.   This finding directly contradicts the evidence that richer countries are more satisfied than poorer countries and that richer people within countries are more satisfied than poorer people. The explanation lies in the fact that your wellbeing is not solely dependent on your own income, it is also affected by your relative income compared to your peers. For example, if you are wealthier than your peers then you should expect to have higher wellbeing. However, if your income rises, but the income of your peers also rises, these effects are cancelled out, leaving your wellbeing unchanged. Learn more: Will faster economic growth make us happier? Economists often use health metrics such as the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) or the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as a proxy for the quality of people’s lives. These are based on questions about time trade-offs, in which people are asked how many years of healthy life they would give up to avoid living with different health conditions. However, neither measure is an accurate guide to what makes people happy or satisfied because they are based on predictions of the badness of different health conditions rather than lived experience of those conditions.  If we only rely on guesses about future feelings, then we get the wrong answers about the effects of different health conditions on subjective wellbeing. For example, DALY estimates suggest that many people think that having depression would be about as bad as walking with a slight limp and they would trade off similar amounts of time to avoid either situation. However, data from people who actually live with these conditions shows that the effect of ‘moderate anxiety or depression’ is associted with a ten times greater change in subjective wellbeing than ‘some mobility issues’ (Dolan and Metcalfe, 2012).  Thankfully, there is a better solution. The ‘wellbeing-adjusted life year’ (WELLBY) allows us to compare different outcomes in a common currency (Frijters et al. 2020). One way, but not the only way, to specify the WELLBY is to say 1 WELLBY is equivalent to increasing life satisfaction for one person, by one point, for a year. This method is structurally similar to D/QALYs in that it seeks to combine quality and quantity of life. The main difference is that WELLBYs are based on direct reports of subjective experience, whereas D/QALYs are based on error-prone predictions of wellbeing in different scenarios. Also, note that D/QALYs are measured on a 0-1 scale whereas WELLBYs are based on a 0-10 scale. Learn more: Using WELLBYs to estimate the moral weights of doubling consumption and averting the death of a child  As the previous sections have shown, research into the best ways to increase global wellbeing has barely begun. At HLI, we aim to find the most cost-effective, well-evidenced ways to improve subjective wellbeing and then communicate those to key decision-makers, such as philanthropists and policymakers, who can provide the resources to scale them up.  Our charity evaluation process starts with the expectation that donations will go furthest when helping those in extreme poverty, but we are confident of finding other funding opportunities that are even more impactful (see Section 5.2). So far, we’ve evaluated two well-evidenced interventions: ​cash transfers and psychotherapy. A large number of academic studies show that cash transfers are a very effective way to reduce poverty and the strength of this evidence led GiveWell to recommend GiveDirectly as one of their top charities. However, we believed that providing group psychotherapy for people with depression in low-income countries could be even more cost-effective than cash transfers. After a rigorous search, we identified StrongMinds as one of the best charities delivering this intervention. We estimate that GiveDirectly produces 8 (95% CI: 1, 32) WELLBYs per $1,000, based on 35 studies and 92,963 participants. We estimate that StrongMinds produces 30 (95% CI: 15, 75) WELLBYs, based on 74 studies and 28,491 participants. Therefore, we find that StrongMinds is 3.7 times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly. This is a surprising and important result. We’ve demonstrated that it’s possible to compare seemingly incomparable outcomes by measuring their effects in terms of subjective wellbeing. By doing so, we found a new and outstanding funding opportunity for philanthropists and policymakers. This provides further evidence that we shouldn’t rely on our intuitions about what makes people happier and should prioritise further research on the best ways to measure and increase global wellbeing.  We’re excited to explore other promising opportunities to improve subjective wellbeing on a larger scale. In this section, we set out the empirical and theoretical questions where further research could be most impactful. Learn more: read our research agenda  We plan to examine interventions at three levels of scale: In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in terms of subjective wellbeing, we need data. Thankfully, there is now plenty of data available on the effect of certain interventions on the happiness, life satisfaction, and mental health of recipients. However, cost-effectiveness evaluations are sensitive to a number of other important factors for which the data is more limited and our modelling is more uncertain. These include the costs to deliver interventions, the effects of the interventions over time (which requires multiple, long-term follow-ups), the effects on other household members, and the household size. Interventions provided to an individual often have ‘spillover’ benefits for other members of their household too. These spillover effects may even be greater than the direct benefit to the recipient. For example, in a household of four, if one member receives an intervention that improves their wellbeing it would only require a spillover effect of 33% for the household effect to be more important. If more data was collected, uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness analyses would be reduced and resource allocation would be more accurate. Learn more: household spillovers for cash transfers and psychotherapy  Even with valid measures and sufficient data, identifying the best way to help others also involves some uncomfortable philosophical dilemmas and theoretical questions. One particularly pressing problem is defining the ‘neutral point’, the point where someone is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. If someone reports their life satisfaction score is 6/10 (on a 0-10 scale) is it better to: (a) extend their life for one year, or (b) improve their life satisfaction by one unit for two years? If the neutral point is 5/10, then (a) gives them one extra unit of wellbeing and (b) gives them two. However, if the neutral point is 0/10, (a) gives them six units and (b) gives them two. Hence, defining the neutral point is key to decisions about whether to extend or improve a life. It is not clear where the neutral point is and there has been little discussion of how to determine this. Researchers sometimes treat the midpoint of subjective wellbeing scales (5/10) as the point where someone is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, or neither happy nor unhappy. But if we take this as the neutral point, this has the controversial implication that many people, particularly those in low-income countries, have lives that are net negative (if we only consider their wellbeing). Other researchers treat the bottom of the scale (0/10) as the neutral point but this has a different, but also controversial, implication that it is impossible for anyone to have a life that is net negative.  Learn more: a philosophical review of Open Philanthropy’s Cause Prioritisation Framework Coming soon: a working paper on defining the neutral point There are many ways to increase the wellbeing of others through your career and/or donations. In this section, we highlight the most promising opportunities for impact. There are many organisations doing a tremendous amount of good to improve wellbeing in the world. You can make an exceptional difference to the lives of others by donating thoughtfully to the most cost-effective and evidence-based charities. In addition to supporting our recommended charities, you can also fund further research by making a tax-deductible donation to the Happier Lives Institute. One of the biggest challenges to increasing global wellbeing is establishing a strong evidence base of cost-effective interventions. Governments are understandably reticent to scale up unproven interventions, but promising interventions can only prove their value if they receive sufficient funding. Therefore, philanthropists and grantmakers have a vital role to play in supporting innovation and research. Learn more: our latest advice for donors There are many potentially valuable research directions including: identifying the root causes of mental illnesses; improving preventive interventions; advancing the scale-up of existing treatments; and developing new treatments or improving existing ones e.g. psychedelic-assisted mental health treatments If you’re a researcher that conducts studies to determine the effects of an intervention, please make sure you collect data on subjective wellbeing. And not just for the recipient; the effects on other members of the household can be just as significant. In order to conduct an accurate cost-effectiveness evaluation, it’s also important to measure the effects over time so plan to conduct follow-up surveys to determine how long the effects last. Learn more: what are the most pressing research questions?  Non-profit organisations serve a very valuable role, particularly in low-income settings where governance is weak, such as conflict-affected regions (where the prevalence of mental disorders is exceptionally high) or in locations where the local government has no reach, such as rural or remote areas. NGOs can also be innovative in ways that governments are less likely to be, for example by finding new ways to improve effectiveness or lower costs and may be able to encourage governments to scale-up services. For example, Sangath has worked with state governments in India to train community health workers to deliver low-cost mental health interventions at scale. Given the size of the treatment gap and the scope for innovation, we’re excited to see new non-profits being set up to experiment with different delivery methods. Charity Entrepreneurship, a non-profit incubator, provides training and guidance to those wishing to start new charities. In 2020, they conducted a detailed search for interventions that improve mental health and subjective welľbeing. Tech entrepreneurship also seems very promising. Examples include Headspace (a meditation app), Happify (happiness-training exercises), MindEase (anxiety relief), UpLift (CBT for depression), and Sanvello (a support platform for mental health). Digital mental health is still in its infancy. However, if effective and commercially viable products can be delivered at scale, it would make an enormous dent in the burden of global mental illness. Advocates can raise awareness of neglected global priorities like mental health and press policymakers to provide more and better services. This could include campaigning, journalism, lobbying, or work in think tanks at a national or international level. Even those engaged in research and intervention delivery can undertake advocacy work alongside their other activities.  A key role that advocates can play is bringing together diverse actors and stakeholders. Different groups, such as clinicians, civil society, and economists, take different approaches to advocacy which can result in them passing contradictory messages to decision-makers. Improvements in advocacy could involve greater coordination of these messages, clearer communication to decision-makers, and better use of evidence of the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in low-income countries to inform decision-makers. There are tremendous opportunities for policymakers that wish to increase the wellbeing of their populations as cost-effectively as possible. Where funding and political will exists, they can scale up the evidence-based interventions developed and tested by researchers and non-profits. And even if no additional funding is available, there are likely to be many ways to use existing budgets more effectively, such as shifting mental health expenditure from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services.

If you’re tired yet unable to fall asleep, it could be due to your circadian rhythm being off, daytime napping, anxiety, or many other factors. Some days — no matter how much coffee you consume — it’s a struggle to keep your eyes open, let alone complete the tasks you need to do at home or work. Yet all too often, when you finally climb into bed, you find yourself wide awake.  It’s frustrating. What the heck is going on? Before you reach for those sleeping pills, discover all the things that could cause you to be tired all day but awake at night. Once you identify what might be going on, you can take action to support better sleep. The circadian rhythm is like an internal timekeeper for everything our bodies do in a 24-hour period, explains sleep specialist W. Christopher Winter, MD, author of “The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How To Fix It.” This system uses light, dark, and our biological clock to regulate body temperature, metabolism, hormones (including melatonin), and sleep. The body’s master clock is called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Located in the brain, the SCN controls melatonin production. This hormone helps regulate sleep. During the day when it’s light outside, melatonin levels remain low. Later in the day, as it grows darker, our bodies produce more melatonin, with levels peaking between 2 and 4 a.m. before falling again. Our bodies are best primed to fall asleep about 2 hours after melatonin levels start to rise. Everybody has their own circadian rhythm, Winter explains, which to some extent is genetic. So, unlike what your parents told you when you were a kid, there’s no reason you “need” to go to bed at a certain time. “I don’t care what someone’s schedule is, as long as it feels right for them and is healthy,” Winter says.  However, if you’re tired but can’t sleep, your circadian rhythm may be off. This could be a sign of delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). This occurs when you fall asleep 2 or more hours later than what’s considered “normal” (10 p.m. to 12 a.m.), making it difficult to wake up in the morning for school or work. DSPS affects young people more, with a prevalence between about 7 and 16%. About 1% of adults have DSPS. Many people use the words “tired,” “sleepy,” and “fatigued” interchangeably, but there’s a subtle difference, says Winter. At the end of a marathon, you feel fatigued — you likely don’t have the energy or motivation to run another marathon and perhaps not even walk the distance to your car.  But you’re not sleepy — you wouldn’t doze off laying on the grass beyond the finish line. Rather, being sleepy is when you can barely keep yourself awake, Winter says.  If you’re tired but can’t sleep once the sun sets, it could be a sign of delayed sleep phase syndrome. If not that, it could be something else or a combination of things. Below are some reasons why you might constantly be tired, especially during the day. Naps aren’t inherently bad. In fact, napping has several health benefits. However, the wrong nap strategy can keep you up when you should be getting deeper Zzz’s. Research suggests that long naps and napping later in the afternoon can cause you to take longer to fall asleep at night, sleep poorly, and wake up more during the night. Winter recommends keeping naps 20–30 minutes long, and napping at the same time every day so your body can anticipate it. A racing mind isn’t conducive to peacefully nodding off. No wonder sleep disturbance is a diagnostic symptom for some anxiety disorders, which are common risk factors for insomnia. Anxiety also leads to increased arousal and alertness, which can delay sleep even further. According to a review published in 2019, up to 90% of people diagnosed with depression also complain about their sleep quality. Insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep-disordered breathing, and restless legs syndrome were all reported. The relationship between sleep issues and depression is complicated. It appears to disrupt circadian rhythms. Inflammation, changes in brain chemicals, genetic factors, and more may all affect the sleep-depression relationship. Maybe it’s time to reconsider that afternoon latte or energy drink. On average, caffeine has a half-life of 5 hours. It may be no surprise, then, that research suggests that even 200 milligrams (mg) of caffeine — about 16 ounces of brewed coffee — 16 hours before bed may impact your sleep. Downing 400 mg of caffeine 6 hours or less before bedtime can significantly reduce sleep quality. Winter recommends cutting off caffeine consumption 4–6 hours before you go to bed. Put down the smartphone! The blue light emitted from phones, tablets, laptops, and TV screens suppresses evening melatonin production and decreases sleepiness. Winter recommends ceasing the use of any devices 2 hours before bed. You may also consider wearing blue-light blocking glasses at night. Difficulty sleeping is a common symptom of COVID. This could be due to factors such as stress or an autoimmune response to the virus. A 2021 study of 236,379 people with COVID found that about 5% of them experienced insomnia. Up to 10% of those with severe infections that required hospitalization had sleeping difficulties. Sleeping difficulties may be more prevalent in people with long COVID, according to a 2022 data analysis. Researchers found that over 40% of 1,321 people with long-lasting COVID symptoms experienced moderate to severe sleeping difficulties. The COVID pandemic itself is associated with increasing sleep-related issues, according to a 2022 study. Social isolation, economic hardships, and parenting challenges are among the possible causes. Delayed sleep phase syndrome isn’t the only disorder that can make you sleepy but not tired at night. Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome can do the same. In sleep apnea, breathing repeatedly stops or is very shallow, then starts again. With restless legs syndrome, your legs feel uncomfortable, triggering you to want to move them. Both conditions can disrupt nighttime sleep, which then causes daytime sleepiness. Shop all Healthline-approved products for snoring and sleep apnea in our sleep shop. The connection between diet and sleep is a bit unclear.  In a 2019 study, researchers looked at excessive daytime sleepiness and diet. They found that replacing 5% of one’s daily caloric intake from protein with equal amounts of saturated fats or carbs increased the risk of daytime sleepiness.  On the other hand, replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, protein, or carbs reduced the risk of excessive daytime sleepiness.  They conclude that dietary changes may help people with sleep disorders. A 2016 review found that high-fat diets were associated with less REM sleep, more deep sleep, and increased arousal from sleep.  In the short term, a high-carb diet may be associated with more REM sleep, less deep sleep, and falling asleep faster. However, in the long run, eating evening meals high in protein may correlate with less daytime sleepiness. According to this review, what you eat before going to bed may affect the quality of your sleep. For example, almonds, kiwifruit, and fatty fish contain melatonin, a hormone that signals your body to sleep. However, the review’s authors say more research is necessary to determine if any one eating pattern promotes or impairs nighttime sleep and daytime energy. Naturally, being tired during the day can sap productivity — and possibly make you irritable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that not getting quality, restful sleep on a regular basis puts you at increased risk of: A regular, consistent sleep and wake schedule is Winter’s top suggestion for anyone who’s tired but can’t sleep. You may also want to shift your bedtime, he says.  Think about it like this: You don’t sit in a restaurant for an hour just because it’s lunchtime — you go when you’re hungry. Why lie in bed and wait around for sleep? Hold off on getting between the sheets until you’re tired, and only do things that won’t stimulate your mind leading up to that time. Then, follow the usual good sleep practices:  Also stick to calming activities before bed, such as reading, journaling, or meditation. If anxiety makes your brain hum at night, set aside 20 to 30 minutes of designated “worry time” during the day, ideally at least 2 hours before bedtime, suggests Michelle Drerup, PsyD, a psychologist with the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center. Journal on what’s worrying you. Then write down solutions to address those concerns. At night, when you’re tempted to let your mind race, simply remind yourself that you’ve dealt with things and need to let it go. Or tell yourself that you’ll worry during your set time tomorrow — but now is the time to sleep. If you try a few of these remedies and still wonder “Why am I tired, but can’t sleep?” talk to a doctor. “Nobody comes into my office and says, ‘I kick my legs 400 times in the night,’” Winter says. “They say, ‘I can’t sleep.’”  By telling a doctor about your sleep problems, they can ask questions and, if necessary, run some sleep tests to diagnose the underlying problem. Then you can receive the proper treatment to address the cause and help you sleep better. Winter doesn’t recommend sleep medications unless someone has a condition such as restless legs syndrome, is a shift worker, or is trying to prevent jet lag before a trip. “When we use a sedative like Ambien, Benadryl, or melatonin, we confuse sedation with sleep. That reinforces the belief that something is wrong with your sleep,” he says. “But it does nothing positive for sleep, it just induces sedation.” If you’re still curious, since sleep medications can have side effects and impact certain health conditions, always try other remedies first and talk to a doctor or sleep specialist before taking any sleeping pills. They can help you determine which may be best for you. If you’re tired but can’t sleep, it may be a sign that your circadian rhythm is off. However, being tired all day and awake at night can also be caused by poor napping habits, anxiety, depression, caffeine consumption, blue light from devices, sleep disorders, and even diet.  If you keep saying, “I’m so tired but can’t sleep!” and everyday sleep remedies don’t help, talk to a doctor. They can help determine the underlying problem and recommend solutions that will help you get restful sleep so you have daytime energy.

      " Stressful feelings and poor sleep hygiene can keep you tossing and turning at night. Learn how to fall asleep quickly and enjoy better sleep, even when you’re overtired. Approximately one in five American adults fail to get enough sleep each night, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.1 Unfortunately, overtiredness can cause unwanted side effects that impact your overall wellness and quality of life—including your ability to get a good night’s rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve experienced the feeling of being unable to fall asleep, despite being sleep deprived, keep reading. We’re breaking down the possible reasons behind this phenomenon, as well as the steps you can take to stop losing sleep, fall asleep faster, and wake up feeling refreshed. Although it may vary slightly, the average adult requires about eight hours of sleep per night to feel well-rested, alert, and ready to tackle the day ahead. Sadly, about 30% of working Americans get less than six hours per night on average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2  When you skimp on crucial slumber, you’re likely to feel the effects of sleep deprivation the following day. You may feel excessively sleepy, irritable, unmotivated, and have a difficult time staying awake and focused during work meetings or at school. A lack of sleep can result in poor coordination, longer reaction times, and reduced vigilance. This makes overtiredness a safety hazard for driving or workplace accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the effects of sleep loss aren’t only immediately noticeable in your daily performance—they can also have a long-term impact on your health. Sleep deprivation has been associated with a higher risk for certain health conditions and illnesses, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and heart attack. It’s important to note that, although good sleep is fundamental to your health, the amount of sleep your body needs and the effects of sleep loss can vary from person to person. For this reason, it’s essential to always consult with a qualified health professional if you can’t sleep at night or have ongoing concerns about your sleep health.  Your body is like an intelligent machine that’s programmed to function best with a particular amount of sleep. It has a variety of sensitive and intricate systems that can be thrown off balance as a result of sleep deprivation. For example, overtiredness can impact both your mental state and your body’s physical chemistry, which can then affect your ability to doze off. A physician or sleep specialist will be able to help you pinpoint the reasons behind sleep troubles, including why you’re tired but can’t sleep, when they arise. However, there are a few common culprits to be mindful of when you find overtiredness keeping you awake. Keep scrolling to learn more. Findings in the American Psychological Association’s Stress in America 2020 survey show that stress levels are significantly higher today than they have been in the past.3 When you’re stressed, your body responds with a “fight or flight” reaction. This creates a hyper-alert feeling that can make it more difficult to sleep, even when you’re overtired. Signs of “fight or flight” can include an elevated heart rate, faster breathing, and an increased release of stress hormones like cortisol. A spike in cortisol can help you feel hyper-aware in stressful or threatening situations but can be problematic at bedtime, especially when stress isn’t managed properly.  Your body’s internal clock—also known as circadian rhythm—helps signal when it’s time to transition into sleep and when it’s time to wake up through a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. This sleep-wake cycle can be disrupted by various factors, such as pulling all-nighters or working late night shifts. When this cycle is thrown off balance, it can make it even harder to fall asleep and stay asleep without interruption. Paying attention to your body’s sleep-wake circadian rhythm is an important part of getting a good night’s slumber, especially if you’ve been skimping on crucial shut-eye. Research shows that melatonin supplements may be an effective option for aiding with sleep troubles caused by irregular sleep-wake cycles. This may explain why approximately 3 million American adults currently take melatonin supplements. These supplements may be particularly effective for individuals who regularly fall asleep very late and wake up late the next day (also known as delayed sleep phase syndrome).4 Sleep habits can have a huge impact on your ability to fall asleep, even when you’ve missed out on Zzzs the night before. Sleep hygiene refers to the combination of healthy habits and environmental factors that set you up for the best sleep possible. This includes habits such as keeping a regular sleep schedule, building a soothing nighttime routine, turning your bedroom into a relaxing sleep oasis, and avoiding certain foods and beverages close to bedtime. Some signs of poor sleep hygiene include difficulty falling or staying asleep, fragmented sleep, or daytime sleepiness. If you regularly lack consistency in your sleep schedule and sleep quality, this may also be a tell-tale sign of poor sleep hygiene.  Simply put, there is no substitute for good sleep. Your body performs a number of important processes while you sleep that are essential to maintaining a healthy mind and body. If you find that you’re overtired yet can’t fall asleep at night, it may help to focus on healthy sleep habits and effective techniques to manage stress. Here are a few sleep tips to keep in mind. If you’re experiencing sleeplessness that persists longer than two weeks, always consult with a healthcare professional, as this can be a sign of a more serious underlying illness. Sometimes, when you can’t fall asleep, it’s nice to know that a bit of extra support is available when you need it.

      "Sleepy versus tired. We often say that we feel tired but actually in order to fall asleep we need to be 'sleepy'. But how can we tell the difference? As you probably have experienced you may feel exhausted but then you get into bed and sleep doesn't come. This may be because actually you have associated your bed with vigilance and anxiety around sleep so as a result, your become wakeful- at the wrong time. Adrenalin and sleep The biggest barrier to sleep is when you associate your bed with anxiety and so when you go to bed you suddenly feel alert or unable to drop off. This is because you have spent so much time in bed feeling negatively towards sleep that now your body thinks you are in danger.  Step 1 If this is the case then the first thing you need to do is to learn how to use your bodies natural sleep drive to help you drop off. Set your alarm earlier than usual and go to bed a bit later. Although this sounds crazy, actually this helps as you will build a much stronger ‘appetite’ for sleep. Step 2 We have all laid in bed at night and felt like sleep is never going to come but what is the best thing to do? My mum always used to say, 'just lie there, at least you're resting'. Bless her, she was trying to be helpful but now as an Insomnia Specialist I realise how damaging to sleep this advice can be. Poor sleep is a 'learnt' behaviour which means we basically train ourselves to sleep poorly. If we can't sleep one night, let's say because it's too hot or too noisy, we end up lying in bed for ages and become irritated and inevitably start to worry about the lack of sleep. If we continue to connect our bed with these types of negative feelings night after night then soon our bed becomes a cue for these types of feelings and simply by going to bed we start to feel wound up and worried. If you are wide awake and in bed the best thing that you can do is leave the bedroom. Go downstairs and get a glass of water, watch TV for a while or read a book and when you feel sleepy go back to bed again. This way, you are reducing the amount of time you spend in bed awake and keeping the relationship between bed and sleep strong. Step 3 Clear your mind  Some people find that even if they are sleepy they are still unable to fall asleep due to their minds working overtime. We suddenly think of all the things we have on our to- do list, worry about the future and start stewing on all our past regrets and mistakes! This 'racing mind' is very common and one of the best ways to begin to quieten your mind is to get into the habit of writing things down. Make time each day to sit and write down all your thoughts and worries and then after 20 minutes close the book and go and do something pleasurable. Often seeing things in black and white can give a different perspective and once it's on paper we are less likely to keep going over it in our heads.

      "Do you constantly press the snooze button in the morning? Sleeping for an extra five to ten minutes may seem divine. However, they can often cause morning fatigue and grogginess! Certain morning habits can help you re-energize, eliminate stress, and build focus that is commonly caused by the chaotic morning rush. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, morning habits help to create a happier life, complete with fulfillment and maximum productivity. Health Shots spoke to Dr Aniket Mule, consultant internal medicine, Wockhardt Hospitals Mira Road, Mumbai, in order to find some great tips which can help make the morning energetic and refreshed. Say no to snoozing, ladies! You must avoid falling asleep again. If you do so, you will end up feeling fatigued and inactive. Try to get up and start the day immediately after the alarm rings. Also, keep your alarm away from your bed instead of keeping it next to you so that you’ll be forced to get up and move your body to turn it off. In any case, it is a good idea to be well-hydrated. Starting your day by drinking a glass of water can help to keep your morning laziness at bay. Water will flush out the toxins from the body, which means a healthy gut and a glowing you. Dr Mule says, “If you feel fatigued in the morning, it is probably due to dehydration. Having a glass of water will freshen you up before starting the day.” Sunlight, especially the one soaked in the morning, helps boost serotonin in your brain, which can give you more energy and keep you calm, positive, and focused. Avoid being in the sun at noon, when it is at its highest point and emits the most UVB rays. It’s a tried-and-true method for getting your lazy ass out of bed. Getting some physical activity in the morning is the best thing you can do for your health. Exercising or practicing yoga can be the body’s natural way of waking itself up after being immobile for long hours during the night. Dr Mule says, “Stretch, do yoga, or even other exercises like walking after waking up to avoid being groggy. Doing so can help you stay energized.” Try to do some form of exercise in the morning without fail. A study published in the journal BJPsych International states that music stimulates our brain circuits and boosts both creativity and productivity. So if you really want to say bye bye to morning tiredness and laziness, listen to music, and lift your mood. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you cannot afford to skip it. According to Dr Mule, “Skipping breakfast will leave you more tired. So, eat oats, fruits, or eggs. But, avoid high carbohydrate intake and fatigue. A low-carb breakfast would improve cognition and mood.” Along with your healthy breakfast, make sure you add some energy-boosting foods to your morning meal. Foods such as pumpkin seeds, walnuts, dates and almonds are the best sources to get the instant energy boost. They can be your pre workout or evening snack as well. Select Topics of your interest and let us customize your feed. The only thing that never worries you about waking up refreshed is your bedtime routine. A bedtime routine, on the other hand, is essential. So, sleep on time, turn off your phone an hour before bedtime, and avoid drinking coffee at night. “Some people have a habit of smoking after waking up. Well, this can land you in trouble. It is a well-known fact that smoking is injurious to health. It is best to avoid it and start your day with meditation instead,” says Dr Mule.

You may feel tired in the morning if you’re not getting enough sleep. It may also relate to your mental or physical health. Speak with your to find the cause. In the meantime, making a few lifestyle changes may help you fight morning fatigue. When waking up is hard to do, consider the following strategies. We’ve all had those mornings when we just can’t shake a feeling of sluggishness, even when we’ve technically gotten enough sleep. In an effort to perk up on tired days, many of us load up on cup after cup of coffee. But over-caffeinating can leave us jittery and anxious (not to mention perpetually running to the bathroom). Perhaps there’s a better way to banish morning fatigue and get on with your day with the energy you need. That beloved button on top of your alarm clock may not be so helpful after all. Spending the last half hour or so of nighttime rest in what researchers call “fragmented sleep” has consequences for your ability to function throughout the day. Pro-tip: Try the 90-minute sleep cycle hack by setting two alarms — one for 90 minutes before you want to wake up and one for when you actually want to wake up. The theory is that the 90 minutes of sleep you get between snoozes will be a full sleep cycle, allowing you to wake up after your REM state, instead of during. Fatigue is a classic symptom of dehydration, and even a mild case can trigger feelings of sleepiness, changes in cognitive ability, and mood disruptions. Let a glass of water freshen up your entire body before you get moving. Pro-tip: If you find you still can’t shake morning lethargy, try upping your intake of water and other noncaffeinated beverages throughout the day. There’s a reason it feels so good to stretch when you wake up. Overnight, during REM sleep, your muscles are literally paralyzed (atonia), and reactivating them releases energy-stimulating endorphins. Pro-tip: If you have a bit of time for morning yoga, take it; just 25 minutes has been shown to boost energy levels and brain function. Cold showers are reported to reduce sick-day absences from work. If you don’t want to take a full shower, a splash of cold water to the face, to signal a temperature change to your body, may also do the trick. Is getting out of bed the main problem? Keep a spray bottle or water mist by your bedside table so you can lean over and mist yourself without even opening your eyes! Pro-tip: One cult-favorite product is Saborino’s Morning Face Mask from Japan, which has essential oils to activate your senses. In one minute, this sheet mask cleanses, invigorates, and moisturizes your skin. Note: People with sensitive skin may want to avoid this product. The jury is still out on whether breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But research does say that skipping this first meal can negatively affect your energy and ability to pay attention throughout the day. Food is fuel. Give your body some calories to put it into action at the start of the day. But if you’re working out in the morning, remember to eat after, not before. This will (a) burn more calories, (b) boost your metabolism, and (c) help you avoid an unsettled stomach. Pro tip: Build a fatigue-fighting breakfast instead.Since what you eat at breakfast can affect how you feel for hours, making the right choice is critical for your morning. Reach for a combination of fatigue-fighting foods like lean proteins, whole grains, nuts, and lower-sugar fruits. All breakfasts are not created equal, so take stock of your morning food choices. Sugary items like sweetened coffee drinks, pastries, and breakfast cereals can lead to the classic blood sugar spike-and-drop that leaves you feeling drained. Pro-tip: Pay attention to nutrition labels to see how much sugar you’re getting at breakfast — and cut back wherever possible. Keep whole foods like apples, carrots, and oranges on hand for easy access. That’s right, we said less coffee — but not none! Though coffee has plenty of health benefits, chugging a lot in the morning may indirectly contribute to increased fatigue later in the day. Participants in one study reported feeling more tired the day after they had consumed caffeinated drinks. Experimenting with a reduced amount of caffeine in the morning actually may make you less tired. Pro-tip: Avoid the big mugs. Purchase a smaller cup, if you have to, to help reduce the amount you drink. Sunlight bumps up your body’s serotonin levels, leading to improved sleep — and, therefore, increased daytime energy. And, according to a series of studies at the University of Rochester, spending time in nature “makes people feel more alive.” Sounds like a very good reason to carve out a portion of your morning in the great outdoors. Pro-tip: If going outside is a chore in the early morning, adjust your curtain so that the sunlight seeps in when you’re getting ready to wake up. Sure, when you want to crawl back into bed, exercise may sound pretty unappealing — but it may be exactly what your body needs to get help booting up. Research consistently correlates aerobic exercise with reduced fatigue. See if you can squeeze in a quick walk or bike ride, or try a longer workout for even more benefit. Pro-tip: When pressed for time, get your body up with a few rounds of high-knees and jumping jacks. Even 30 seconds of torso twists could do the trick, or plan a short cardio commute on your way to work. Is it possible that negative feelings about your job or stressors at home are draining you of morning oomph? You may not be able to fix certain situations overnight, but once you’ve identified them as a source of mental and physical exhaustion, you can often take some action to alleviate them. Pro-tip: Streamline harried mornings at home by making school lunches the night before, or make time for morning meditations and create calm before your day begins. Sometimes all we need for an energy boost is a little excitement on the horizon. To beat morning fatigue, consider scheduling a phone call with a friend during your commute, penciling in an outdoor walk on your midmorning break, or pre-making an appealing breakfast that calls you out of bed. Pro-tip: Let another schedule determine yours. Make an earlier morning podcast or radio show part of your wake-up routine. If morning fatigue becomes a chronic problem, it could be caused by depression or anxiety. People with depression can feel worse in the morning or only feel depressed in the morning.  The only way to know, however, is to track your mood or see a professional. Pro-tip: Dig a little deeper. Asking some key questions about your mental health state may reveal an underlying condition that needs professional attention. If your bedtime habits can have so profound an effect on your rest, so too could your waking routine. You’ve probably heard of sleep hygiene — the handful of best practices that help you fall asleep at night. These include: Getting up at the same time each morning helps maintain circadian rhythm, the internal biological clock that’s responsible for feelings of sleepiness. Make an effort to rise at the same time every day — even on weekends — to see if you can banish the midmorning slump. Sarah Garone, NDTR, is a nutritionist, freelance health writer, and food blogger.

      " Many cases of tiredness are due to stress, not enough sleep, poor diet and other lifestyle factors. Try these self-help tips to restore your energy levels. If you feel you're suffering from fatigue, which is an overwhelming tiredness that isn't relieved by rest and sleep, you may have an underlying medical condition. Consult a GP for advice. A good way to keep up your energy through the day is to eat regular meals and healthy snacks every 3 to 4 hours, rather than a large meal less often. Read more about healthy eating. You might feel that exercise is the last thing on your mind. But, in fact, regular exercise will make you feel less tired in the long run, so you'll have more energy. Even a single 15-minute walk can give you an energy boost, and the benefits increase with more frequent physical activity. Start with a small amount of exercise. Build it up gradually over weeks and months until you reach the recommended goal of 2 hours 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.

See a GP for a referral for talking treatment on the NHS, or for advice on seeing a private therapist. Caffeine is a stimulant which means it makes you feel more awake. But it can also disrupt your usual sleep rhythms, leading to problems sleeping and then daytime tiredness. Products that caffeine is found include: The effects of caffeine on the body can last up to 7 hours, so you may want to avoid it in the evening if you are having trouble sleeping. If you do want to cut caffeine out of your diet completely then the charity The Sleep Charity recommends you reduce your intake gradually. Trying to suddenly stop can lead to insomnia and headaches. Although a couple of glasses of wine in the evening can help you fall asleep, you sleep less deeply after drinking alcohol. The next day you'll be tired, even if you sleep a full 8 hours. Cut down on alcohol before bedtime. You'll get a better night's rest and have more energy. The NHS recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week and should try to have several alcohol-free days each week. Read more about how to cut down on alcohol.

      "What you call “laziness” may be fatigue, lack of motivation, or brain fog. Exploring the cause of how you feel is the first step toward resolving it. Giving yourself a break, setting realistic goals, asking for help, exercising, and eating a balanced diet may also help. Need a lazy day? It happens to the best of us. In these busy times, taking the occasional lazy day isn’t just alright but much needed.  But if you find that you’re taking lazy days more often than not, and you’re having trouble getting things done, it could be a sign that there’s something going on.  A lack of passion for your job, an overwhelming to-do list, and even an underlying medical condition are just some of the things that can interfere with your desire to get things done. We cover all the bases here and tell you how to stop laziness so you can be more productive.  “How can I stop laziness?” The answer may not be as cut and dry as you’d expect. While some people may be more prone to being lazy than others, even highly productive people can find it challenging to get things done sometimes. Here are some tips to help you get rid of laziness and get a grasp on your productivity. Setting unrealistic goals and taking on too much can lead to burnout. While not an actual clinical diagnosis, the symptoms of burnout are recognized by medical professionals. Job burnout can cause exhaustion, loss of interest and motivation, and a longing to escape.  Avoid overloading by setting smaller, attainable goals that will get you where you want to be without overwhelming you along the way. Perfectionism is on the rise and it’s taking a psychological toll.  One 2017 study that looked at college students between 1989 and 2016 found an increase in perfectionism over the years. Researchers noted “young people [are] now facing more competitive environments, more unrealistic expectations, and more anxious and controlling parents than generations before.” This rise in perfectionism is causing people to be overly critical of themselves and others. It’s also led to an increase in depression and anxiety. Another smaller study of college students concluded that expecting perfection was related to avoidant coping, which causes you to avoid dealing with stressors. Negative self-talk can derail your efforts to get things done in every aspect of your life. Telling yourself that you’re a lazy person is a form of negative self-talk.  You can stop your negative internal voice by practicing positive self-talk. Instead of saying, “There’s no way I can get this done,” say, “I’ll give it my all to make it happen.”  Planning how you will get something done can make it easier to get there. Be realistic about how much time, effort, and other factors are needed to meet your goal and create an action plan. Having a plan will provide direction and confidence that can help even if you hit a hurdle along the way. Take a moment to think about what your strengths are when setting goals or gearing up to tackle a task. Try to apply them to different aspects of a task to help you get things done. Research has shown that focusing on strengths increases productivity, positive feelings, and engagement in work. Patting yourself on the back for a job well done can help motivate you to keep going. Consider writing down all of your accomplishments along the way in everything you do, whether at work or home. It’s a great way to boost your confidence and positivity, and fuel you to carry on. Many people believe that asking for help is a sign of weakness. But not asking for help could be setting you up for failure. A 2018 study found that people who don’t ask coworkers for help were more likely to be dissatisfied in their jobs and had lower levels of job performance. They were also perceived less favorably by their employers. Asking for help improves your chances of success and helps you connect with others who can encourage and motivate you. We all have our favorite distractions we turn to when we’re just not feeling like doing a task — whether it’s scrolling through social media or playing with a pet. Find ways to make your distractions less accessible. This can mean finding a quiet place to work, like the library or an empty room, or using an app to block sites that you scroll mindlessly when you should be on task.  We tend to avoid jobs that we find boring or tedious. Chores like cleaning the gutters or bathroom will never be loads of fun, but you can make them more enjoyable. Try listening music or a podcast, or put on your fitness tracker to see how many calories you burn or steps you get while performing these tasks. Getting a job done is a reward in itself, but some people are driven by external rewards. Focus on what you’ll gain from getting something done, like getting closer to a promotion, or reward yourself for a job well done. Celebrate the end of a big project with a night out or invite friends over for drink after a day of cleaning. When it comes to how to stop laziness, making some healthy changes can be the best way to go. Are you wondering “how can I stop being lazy?” Some foods increase your energy and keep your blood sugar stable so you’re less likely to feel sluggish and lazy. High-protein foods do this, such as: Nutrition and productivity are linked. Steer clear of foods that drain your energy because they’re slow to digest or cause blood sugar spikes. These include: Along with numerous other benefits, exercise is a surefire way to get rid of laziness. Just a few minutes of exercise can increase energy levels, improve mood, and reduce anxiety, stress, and depression — all of which can make you feel drained and unmotivated. Try a short walk or bike ride to combat that lazy feeling.  There are many things you can do to sleep better at night — from avoiding screen time just before bed to limiting nap time during the day. Aim to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night to feel refreshed and ready to tackle the day ahead.  Stress can drain you so you feel too mentally and physically exhausted to do anything. Finding strategies for coping with stress can help improve your mood and give you back the energy and drive to get things done. Time with loved ones, cuddling a pet, and soaking in the tub are just a few ideas. The benefits of drinking water are endless and many can help fight laziness. Staying hydrated can boost energy levels and brain function. It also helps maximize physical performance. A few sips of water can also help perk you up if you’re feeling sluggish. Increased energy levels thanks to improved circulation and oxygen are just a couple of the benefits of quitting smoking. Quitting can also boost your immune system, improve your sex life, and lower your risk of several serious conditions.  Quitting smoking can be difficult, but your doctor can help you create a personalized plan of action. Sometimes it’s not laziness, but a symptom of an underlying condition that may be stopping you from doing the things you should. If you find you’ve lost interest in doing things you would normally enjoy and don’t have the energy or focus to get things done, talk to a doctor. Many mental health conditions can cause symptoms that you may mistake for laziness, such as lack of motivation, chronic fatigue, and social withdrawal. These conditions include: Medical conditions can cause changes to your energy levels and prevent you from being able to function the way you normally would. Examples of these are: Laziness isn’t always a bad thing, and everyone deserves a slow day now and again. Figuring out how to stop being lazy may be as simple as changing the way you approach certain tasks and adopting healthier lifestyle.  If you’re having trouble finding the energy and desire to do things more often, speak to a doctor to determine if an underlying medical condition may be responsible.

      "Not getting enough sleep is one reason why you may be tired. Other possible reasons include nutrient deficiencies, stress, an underlying health condition, and drug side effects. If you have chronic fatigue, see a doctor for a diagnosis. If you’re feeling overly tired or have little energy, you’re not alone. Fatigue may be caused by simple factors like a lack of sleep or coming down with a cold or the flu. However, it can also be caused by underlying health conditions. In most cases, fatigue can be remedied by lifestyle or dietary modifications, correcting a nutrient deficiency, or treating an underlying medical condition. Still, to improve fatigue, you need to get to the bottom of what’s causing it. Here are 12 potential reasons why you’re always tired. Getting enough sleep is essential for overall health. Unfortunately, many of us don’t get enough, which may lead to fatigue. During sleep, your body performs a number of critical processes, including releasing important growth hormones and repairing and regenerating cells. This is why most people wake up feeling refreshed, alert, and energized after a night of high quality sleep. Even though sleep time should be individualized adults should get at least 7 hours of sleep per night for optimal health. Insomnia is a term for any condition that causes difficulty falling or staying asleep. It can have several causes, including menopause, medical conditions, psychological stress, poor sleeping environments, and excessive mental stimulation.  If you’re experiencing insomnia, treatments like natural supplements, medications, and the management of underlying medical conditions may help. Visit your doctor to get the appropriate care and treatment. Nutrient deficiencies may lead you to feel exhausted on a daily basis, even if you’re getting more than 7 hours of sleep. Deficiencies in the following nutrients have been linked to fatigue: If you are experiencing fatigue, discuss with your healthcare professional if it is necessary to test for deficiencies. Typically, fatigue related to a deficiency in one or more nutrients improves once your nutrient levels normalize.  Although some stress is normal, chronic stress can lead to fatigue. In fact, chronic stress may lead to stress-related exhaustion disorder (ED), a medical condition characterized by psychological and physical symptoms of exhaustion. Furthermore, chronic stress may cause structural and functional changes in your brain and lead to chronic inflammation, contributing to symptoms like fatigue. A therapist may also help you develop strategies to reduce stress. Many health insurance plans cover mental health counseling, and virtual therapy is also an option.  If you’re experiencing unexplained, chronic fatigue, you should visit your doctor and discuss your symptoms. They may recommend testing to rule out certain health conditions that cause fatigue, such as: It’s important to know that it’s abnormal to feel exhausted constantly. If you experience frequent fatigue, there are likely one or more causes. Getting proper treatment for an underlying medical condition can help you feel better and improve other areas of health as well. Your diet significantly affects the way you feel. To maintain energy and get the nutrients your body needs to perform critical processes, it’s important to consume a balanced diet high in nutrient-dense foods. When you don’t obtain enough calories and nutrients like protein, your body breaks down fat and muscle to meet energy demands. This leads to losing body fat and muscle mass, which may trigger fatigue. Additionally, diets high in ultra-processed foods impair energy levels. For example, a diet high in added sugar may harm sleep and lead to chronically high blood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in fatigue.  Following a diet low in ultra-processed food and added sugar but rich in nutrient-dense foods like fruits, veggies, legumes, and healthy protein sources may help reduce fatigue and support healthy sleep while providing your body with optimal nutrition.  Although caffeinated beverages like coffee and energy drinks feel like they boost energy, over-reliance on them may make you more tired the next day. That’s because too much caffeine can harm sleep, which may cause fatigue.  Research shows that feeling tired in the morning leads people to consume large amounts of caffeine, which impairs their sleep cycle. In turn, you may overuse coffee or other caffeinated drinks for energy, which continues the cycle of poor sleep followed by too much caffeine. While coffee and caffeinated beverages like green tea may benefit health when consumed in moderation, energy drinks are extremely high in stimulants and added sugar. Thus, you should avoid them whenever possible. If you’re currently experiencing sleep issues and frequently drink caffeinated beverages, try cutting back to see whether it helps improve your sleep and energy levels.  Staying hydrated is important for maintaining energy levels. The many biochemical reactions that take place in your body every day result in a loss of water that needs to be replaced. Dehydration occurs when you don’t drink enough liquid to replace the water lost in your urine, stools, sweat, and breath. Being dehydrated leads to lower energy levels and decreased concentration ability. Although you may have heard that you should drink eight 8-ounce (240-mL) glasses of water daily, hydration needs depend on several factors, including your weight, age, sex, and activity levels.  The key is drinking enough to maintain good hydration. Common symptoms of dehydration include thirst, fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. Maintaining a healthy body weight is essential to overall health. Not only is obesity significantly linked to a greater risk of many chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, but it may also increase your risk of chronic fatigue. Obesity greatly increases your risk of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common cause of daytime fatigue. It’s also linked to increased daytime sleepiness regardless of sleep apnea, suggesting that obesity directly affects the sleep cycle. Maintaining a healthy body weight may support good sleep and energy levels, while getting high quality sleep may help prevent weight gain and reduce fatigue.  Learn more about what makes a healthy body weight here. Many other conditions may lead to tiredness. It’s important to understand that several factors may contribute to your exhaustion.  Here are a few other common reasons why you may feel tired: If you need help overcoming your addiction contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Even though everyone has days when they feel exhausted, constantly feeling run down and tired isn’t normal. Many possible factors cause chronic fatigue, such as underlying medical conditions, nutrient deficiencies, sleep disturbances, caffeine intake, and chronic stress. If you’re experiencing unexplained fatigue, you must talk with your doctor to find the cause.  In many cases, your fatigue should improve once you identify the underlying cause(s) and make appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments — or get the right treatment for medical conditions.

If you’re feeling chronically exhausted even when you get adequate rest, there may be a medical condition contributing to your fatigue.  Work with a doctor you trust to get the right testing to rule out common health conditions that may be contributing to your fatigue.  Read this article in Spanish.

      "It’s common for people to become tired or even fatigued in our fast-paced modern world. Many times, you may find yourself running from one activity to the next, not pausing to take the time you might need to ground, balance, and soothe your soul. It’s not always easy to pinpoint the exact reason you’re feeling low in energy. If you’re feeling tired persistently or for reasons that aren’t apparent, make an appointment to see your doctor. It could be the sign of an underlying condition, especially if it’s interfering with your daily life. Signs that tiredness could be something more serious include unexplained pain, fever, and headaches. Continue reading to learn about some of the causes of tiredness and simple changes you can make to put a bit more pep in your step. One reason to follow a healthy, balanced diet is that you’ll boost energy levels. Ensure you’re getting enough nutrients by eating whole, fresh foods from a variety of food groups. Pair unrefined carbs with protein for sustained energy levels. Include plenty of fiber and anti-inflammatory foods. Following a balanced diet also promotes healthy digestion, which helps to clear and cleanse your body. In fact, research has linked irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to chronic fatigue. Certain foods might even help to prevent and manage IBS, which could be zapping your energy. The benefits of regular exercise are widely recognized. Exercise releases endorphins that naturally boosting your energy levels. It can also lead to more high-quality sleep. A 2008 study found that regular exercise can reduce symptoms of fatigue. In the study, 36 sedentary young adults did either low-intensity or moderate-intensity exercise over a period of six weeks. Both groups saw improvements in energy levels. Do at least two hours of moderate-intensity exercise each week. To make it easier to stick to an exercise plan, find a workout buddy or hire a personal trainer. Stay properly hydrated to keep your body running at optimum levels. Dehydration can lead to low energy levels. It can also have a negative impact on your sleep by drying out your mouth and nasal passages, and can lead to snoring, hoarseness, and leg cramps. Plus, it can make you less alert and mentally clear the next day. According to a 2014 study, increasing water intake in people who don’t usually drink enough water was found to have beneficial effects on energy. People who decreased their water intake had fewer feelings of calmness, satisfaction, and positive emotions. Feelings of fatigue and inertia were also reported in this group. Lowering your caffeine intake can give you more energy in the long run. Though caffeine may give you an initial boost of energy, after it wears off you may be left feeling depleted. Slowly reducing your caffeine intake will help to reduce feelings of withdrawal as you balance out your natural energy levels. Avoid caffeine after dinnerso you can naturally wind down for a restful night of sleep. Proper rest is essential if you want to maintain energy levels throughout the day. Relax before going to bed, possibly doing some gentle stretches. Improve your sleep area by keeping it clean and maintaining an appropriate temperature. Other tips for better sleep include: Alcohol throws your body off balance and leads to poor sleep, especially if you’re dehydrated. Even though alcohol may seem to help you fall asleep, you won’t sleep as deeply. When you do have alcohol, drink in moderation, and try to have as many alcohol-free days as possible. The chemicals released by your body to combat allergic reactions can cause you to feel tired. They can bring on inflammationof your sinuses, airways, or digestive system. Accompanying head and nose congestion can cause you to sleep poorly. These factors can contribute to brain fog, making it difficult to concentrate and complete your daily activities. Avoid known allergens as much as possible. Keep a diary and try an elimination diet to help identify triggers. See your doctor to determine the cause of your allergies if you’re unsure. They may recommend allergy medications or shots. Stress can zap you of the mental and physical energy needed to carry out your day with ease. Stress hormonescan have a negative effect on your sleep patterns, bodily systems, and overall health. Reduce stress in whatever way your heart so desires. Go to the spa for a pampering treatment or having a massage. Mindfulness practices such as tai chi, meditation, and yoga are great options. Or curl up on the couch with your favorite book or television show. Check in with yourself to establish what mental patterns may be causing low energy levels. Anxiety symptoms include feeling worried, irritable, and nervous. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad, restless, and hopeless. Both conditions can lead to unhealthy sleep patterns and cause tiredness. Consider seeing a therapist for talk therapy, known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This method helps you to get to the root cause of emotional issues so that they can be addressed and overcome. Get up, get moving, and get your energy flowing. This is especially important if you spend a lot of time sitting. Include short bursts of activity throughout the day, especially when you’re feeling pressed for time. Get into the habit of exercising regularly. Making simple changes such as parking your car a little bit farther away, taking the stairs, or walking to do errands are easy ways to sneak in a bit of exercise. Anemia is an iron deficiencythat can lead to tiredness. This is due to low hemoglobin levels, which make it more difficult for oxygen to be carried to your tissues and muscles. It also weakens your immune system, making you more likely to develop illness and infection. Anemia is more common in women than in men. Sometimes it occurs due to pregnancy or heavy menstruation. It can be treated through diet or medication. Here are some iron-rich foods to include in your diet: In terms of energy levels, eating smaller portions more frequently throughout the day may be more beneficial than eating a few large meals. That’s because it keeps your blood sugar levels stable. Eating every three to four hours will make it less likely that your energy crashes, and in turn you’ll be less likely to reach for unhealthy food. Avoid overeating at meals, and stop eating before you are entirely full. Smoking can deplete your energy by reducing your oxygen levels, and making breathing difficult. Quitting smoking is an attainable goal, and there are resources to help. Over-the-counter and prescription medicationsare available that may help you quit. These medications are more effective when combined with counseling. Consider trying one of the many smoking cessation apps available. Discover tips from people who successfully quit smoking. Keep a journal so you can have some type of inner reflection during this time. Take the time to completely unwind, relax, and let go. Deep breathing techniques, gentle stretching, and meditation are excellent ways to unwind. Yoga nidra is the perfect way to replenish your energy. Finding peace in nature is another way to nourish your soul, or you can simply enjoy the beauty of doing nothing. If you feel your tiredness is unusual in some way or is coupled with other symptoms, it may be time to see your doctor. Feeling low in energy could be the result of an underlying health condition, and it’s best to check out this possibility. Conditions that can cause fatigue include: Make lifestyle changes to your routine to increase your vitality. Start with what is most appealing to you, and go from there. You’ll likely start to improve your energy levels so you can feel your best on a daily basis. Above all, honor your body and how you’re feeling. Take a break and allow yourself time to rest when you need to. Avoid pushing yourself beyond your limits, and commit to a healthy plan of action.

It can be caused by a number of factors, including unhealthy lifestyle choices, workplace problems and stress. There are many different ways you can boost your energy, but see your health practitioner first to make sure you don't have an underlying medical problem. Food, which gives us energy, is broken down by the digestive system. Some elements, such as water, are absorbed through the stomach. The rest are absorbed through the small intestine.  The body's preferred energy source is glucose, from carbohydrates , but it can also use fatty acids (from fats) and amino acids (from proteins). Glucose is delivered to virtually every cell in the body by the bloodstream, and is then burned with oxygen to produce energy. Hormones control every step in this process; for example, the pancreas makes the hormone insulin, which helps to control blood sugar levels. If you want more energy, look at your diet and make sure you're following these basic guidelines: A common cause of fatigue is not enough sleep, or poor quality sleep. Suggestions include: Studies suggest that between 50 and 80% of fatigue cases are mainly due to psychological factors. Suggestions include: Most people feel drowsy after lunch.

      "Dragging by mid-morning? Feeling tired all day can sometimes feel like a way of life, to the point where you ignore the weariness as much as possible and just Keep. On. Pushing.  But constant exhaustion is your body’s way of sending you an important message: Either you A) aren’t getting enough quality sleep or B) need to make a lifestyle change to better support your health and ramp up your energy levels. Or hey, maybe both! Fortunately, there’s no shortage of ways to make it happen. Here are 17 science-backed strategies to kick all-day fatigue to the curb — and get your energy back ASAP. It sounds obvious, but more than 1 in 3 U.S. adults aren’t logging the recommended 7 to 9 hours of shut-eye per night. If you’re one of them, start by getting more sleep. You might find that an extra hour or 2 of snoozing is the only thing you actually need to ramp up your daytime energy levels. When you consider your brain’s a whopping 73 percent H2O, it’s no wonder that being dehydrated can zap your energy. The good news? If you tend to fall short on your water intake, just drinking more can be enough to get you revved. Exercise releases energizing hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine, giving you a post workout boost. Just as important? Daily activity is key for helping you snooze more soundly, upping the odds that you wake up refreshed in the morning.  Alcohol signals your body to produce the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, lulling you into a low-energy state at any time of day. And drinking at night can have an especially big impact on daytime tiredness the next day. While alcohol can help you fall asleep faster, it makes your sleep restless and disruptive, leaving you groggy the next morning. For energy that lasts, say yes to complex carbs like whole grains, beans, and sweet potatoes paired with a source of protein and healthy fat. Foods high in refined carbs — white bread, white pasta, white rice, or sugary snacks — cause your blood sugar to spike and quickly crash, which is a recipe for sluggishness. A cuppa joe or two in the morning can deliver a much needed jolt. But caffeine takes hours to clear out of your system, people. So if you’re sipping it in the afternoon or early evening for a boost, there’s a good chance it’ll end up messing with your sleep, leaving you less alert the next day. Ever scarfed down a huge, heavy meal — then felt the immediate urge to take a nap? (We’re looking at you, brunch.) Yup, us too. Big meals divert more energy to your digestive system, which can temporarily leave your brain short on the fuel it needs to fire on all cylinders. But having smaller meals or snacks spaced out throughout the day ups the odds that your noggin has a steady supply of nutrients. Truth is, unchecked tension and anxiety can eat away at your energy levels and leave you feeling physically exhausted. Finding ways to keep your stress in check — from yoga, to meditation, to journaling, to even just carving out time for a bath before bed — won’t just make you happier, it’ll put some literal pep in your step. Forget the idea that naps are lazy. They’re actually proven productivity boosters. And they don’t need to take a ton of time: Just 20 minutes is all you need to power you through the rest of the day. Waking up feeling wonky even though you went to bed at a decent hour? Make sure your room is cool enough, dark enough, and quiet enough so your sleep isn’t getting interrupted. A temperature between 60 to 67°F (15 to 19°C) is optimal for sleep, while blackout shades and a white noise machine or earplugs can work wonders at blocking out any potential disruptions. Spending time on your phone or tablet right before bed is another sleep stealer that might be making you tired in the morning. That’s because electronic devices emit blue light, a stimulating type of light that can make it harder to fall asleep. If possible, steer clear of screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Like, 10-minutes quick. Strolling for that long gives the energy equivalent of taking a 50 milligram tablet of caffeine, one study found — though the study was on stair climbing, so if you’re not in a hilly area, perhaps add a few extra minutes onto your walk. Next time you’re lagging, lace up your sneaks. Scents like lemon, rosemary, and peppermint all have a stimulating effect, making them go-to aromas for helping you feel more alert and focused. Keep a bottle of essential oil in your bag and reach for it whenever you need a quick pick-me-up. Next time you’re feeling like a zombie, head to the nearest park or trail. Spending just 20 minutes in nature has been shown to boost feelings of vitality and give people the sense of feeling more, well, alive, research shows.  You already know the whole spiel about smoking being terrible for your health. But did you know that lighting up can actually cause insomnia? ICYMI, nicotine is a powerful stimulant that can make it pretty hard to fall asleep — causing you to toss and turn and feel exhausted the next day. Cranking up song you love is a no-fail way to get revved up. But don’t just listen. You’ll reap even more energizing benefits if you sing along or tap to the beat, one study found. Staring at a computer, phone, or tablet for too long is a great way to strain your eyes, and can actually give you a headache, make it harder to concentrate, or leave you just wanting to close your eyes. If you’re spending long stretches of time on a device, make it a point to look away every 20 minutes, at something at least 20 feet away, for a full 20 seconds. It’ll give your eyes a break and keep the energy-zapping strain at bay. It’s not all that unusual to feel zonked during the day from time to time, especially if you’re stressed or just not getting great sleep. But if it’s a regular issue or one that’s affecting your work or quality of life, touch base with your doctor. Daytime fatigue could be a sign of an underlying health problem, so it’s important to figure out the root issue. There are lots of strategies for staving off daytime slumps, starting with making sure you’re logging enough quality shut-eye. But if it seems like you’re exhausted during the day no matter what you do, check in with your doc to rule out any underlying medical causes.

      " Oxford CBT / Resources / Blog / Mental Health It is perfectly normal for us to have days where we are tired or sluggish. Perhaps we had a late night the night before or we didn’t sleep well. But if you are finding that you are struggling every day without an endless amount of caffeine or sugar to keep you going, and longing to crawl into bed from lunchtime, you might need to reevaluate your habits and routines. Here are our 8 top tips to help you feel less tired during the day: So many of us do not drink enough water during the day. The recommended intake for an adult is 6-8 glasses (or 1.2L – 1.5L). Dehydration leads very quickly to fatigue so this is an easy and quick way to make a change in your habits. Keeping a bottle of water handy during the day will help up your intake and you can even buy bottles with times marked on the side, to help you track how much you have drunk in the day. It is quite obvious that lack of sleep will make you feel tired. Most adults need between 6 and 9 hours of sleep a night. If you are consistently getting less than 7 you could be at risk from exhaustion and other health issues such as: – Depression – Weight gain – Increase risk of accidents – Lowered immunity – Impaired thinking and mood Interestingly, the snooze button can become your worst enemy. It is so tempting to grab that extra 10 minutes of sleep, but due to a phenomenon called circadian rhythms, you should get up as soon as your alarm has gone off. It sounds strange to say that to combat fatigue you should exercise, but feeling tired daily can be your body’s way of calling out to you to be more active! Exercise raises your metabolism, stimulates your mood and helps you sleep better at night. This exercise doesn’t need to be hours spent at the gym – a short 20-minute walk on your lunch break (or after dinner now it is lighter) can do the trick. Think about what you eat for breakfast. Do you reach for toast, a bowl of cereal, or worse, nothing at all? Your food choices will have a big effect on your energy levels a few hours into the day. Loading up on carbohydrate-heavy foods causes a spike in your blood sugar levels which is then likely followed by a crash, which is what can make you feel like you need a nap! Try to work protein into every meal of the day. If you have time, try scrambled eggs for breakfast, or good quality peanut butter on wholemeal toast. Instead of having a chocolate bar as an afternoon snack, try a smoothie or a protein bar. Having enough protein in your diet is vital to help stop severe changes in your blood sugar levels, which in turn will help you feel more alert.  Check out our article Importance of Diet for Mental Health for more information.  Negativity, stress and depressions are huge suckers of energy and in turn, can make you feel tired. If you are feeling overwhelmed with feelings like this then it is important to speak to a doctor, but everyday general blues could be beaten by some of these mood boosters: Laughing is one of the best ways to increase your energy and feel less tired – plus it costs nothing. Think about something you enjoy that makes you happy and laugh. Watch a funny film or TV programme, call or see a friend who you know can make you giggle. Allow yourself to indulge in a favourite activity every day, and it only has to be for a short time. Read a book, spend time in the garden or listen to music, whatever makes you feel good. Follow our three principles of positivity. Quite often you might feel that a couple of glasses of wine in the evening can help you fall asleep, and although this might be true, you sleep less deeply after drinking alcohol. The next day you’ll feel tired, even if you have slept for a full 8 hours. Try to cut down on alcohol before bedtime as you’ll get a better night’s rest and have more energy the following day. Try to have several alcohol-free days each week. The NHS recommendations are that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week, which is equivalent to 6 pints of average strength beer or 10 small glasses of low strength wine. The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that anyone feeling tired should cut out caffeine gradually and stop having all caffeine drinks after 3 weeks. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, cola and energy drinks. Try to remove caffeine completely from your lifestyle for a month to see if you feel less tired without it. You may find that not consuming as much caffeine as before gives you headaches and if this happens, cut down more slowly on the amount of caffeine that you drink. This could be a sign that your circadian rhythm is off. However, being tired all day and awake at night is most like to be caused by poor napping habits, anxiety, depression, caffeine consumption, blue light from devices, sleep disorders, and diet. If you are finding you are struggling to sleep, then speak to your doctor. Many possible factors cause low energy. If you are experiencing this all of the time then you may have chronic fatigue. Things that cause can be things such as underlying medical conditions, nutrient deficiencies, sleep disturbances, caffeine intake, and chronic stress. There are 3 main types of fatigue. Transient fatigue is caused by extreme sleep reduction or extended waking hours within a short space of time. Cumulative fatigue is sleep interruptions or having to be awake more over a longer period of time. And circadian fatigue is caused by reduced performance during nighttime hours.

      "Home Healthy living Mental wellbeing Fears and phobias 10 ways to fight your fears Whatever it is that scares you, here are 10 ways to help you cope with your day-to-day fears and anxieties. These tips are for people who are coping with everyday fears. If you have been diagnosed with an anxiety-related condition, see our page on generalised anxiety disorder. It’s impossible to think clearly when you’re flooded with fear or anxiety. The first thing to do is take time out so you can physically calm down. Distract yourself from the worry for 15 minutes by walking around the block, making a cup of tea or having a bath. If you start to get a faster heartbeat or sweating palms, the best thing is not to fight it. Stay where you are and simply feel the panic without trying to distract yourself. Place the palm of your hand on your stomach and breathe slowly and deeply. The goal is to help the mind get used to coping with panic, which takes the fear of fear away. Try this breathing technique for stress Avoiding fears only makes them scarier. Whatever your fear, if you face it, it should start to fade. If you panic one day getting into a lift, for example, it’s best to get back into a lift the next day. Try imagining the worst thing that can happen – perhaps it’s panicking and having a heart attack. Then try to think yourself into having a heart attack. It’s just not possible. The fear will run away the more you chase it. It sometimes helps to challenge fearful thoughts. For example, if you’re scared of getting trapped in a lift and suffocating, ask yourself if you have ever heard of this happening to someone. Ask yourself what you would say to a friend who had a similar fear. Life is full of stresses, yet many of us feel that our lives must be perfect. Bad days and setbacks will always happen, and it’s important to remember that life is messy. Take a moment to close your eyes and imagine a place of safety and calm. It could be a picture of you walking on a beautiful beach, or snuggled up in bed with the cat next to you, or a happy memory from childhood. Let the positive feelings soothe you until you feel more relaxed. Sharing fears takes away a lot of their scariness. If you can’t talk to a partner, friend or family member, call a helpline such as Breathing Space on 0800 83 85 87 or Samaritans on 116 123. You could also try a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach over the telephone, with a service such as NHS Living Life. If you would like to find out more about this appointment-based service, you can visit the Living Life website or phone 0800 328 9655 (Mon to Fri, 1pm to 9pm).​ If your fears aren’t going away, you can ask your GP for help. GPs can refer people for counselling, psychotherapy or help through an online mental health service, such as Living Life to the Full. Lots of people turn to alcohol or drugs to self-treat anxiety, but this will only make matters worse. Simple, everyday things like a good night’s sleep, a wholesome meal and a walk are often the best cures for anxiety. Finally, give yourself a treat. When you’ve made that call you’ve been dreading, for example, reinforce your success by treating yourself to a massage, a country walk, a meal out, a book, a DVD, or whatever little gift makes you happy. \n",

      "This content mentions anxiety and panic attacks, which some people may find triggering. This guide provides you with tips on how to manage feelings of anxiety and fear. You can read the guide below, download it as a PDF or buy printed copies in our online shop. Fear is one of the most powerful emotions. It has a very strong effect on your mind and body. It’s a human response that is vital for our survival. It helps us respond to emergencies or dangerous situations; for example, if there is a fire or we’re being attacked. It can also occur in more everyday, non-life-threatening events like exams, public speaking, a job interview, a date, or even a party. It’s a natural reaction to events that put you under pressure. Anxiety is a word we use for fears about the threat of something going wrong in the future, rather than right now. Anxiety can last for a short time and then pass when whatever was causing you worry is over, but it can also last much longer and disrupt your life. Ongoing anxiety can affect your ability to eat, sleep, or concentrate. It can prevent you from enjoying life, travelling, or even leaving the house to go to work or school. When anxiety holds you back from doing the things you want or need to do, it can also affect your health. Some people become overwhelmed by fear and want to avoid situations that might make them frightened or anxious. It can be hard to break this cycle, but there are lots of ways to do it. You can learn to feel less fearful and to cope with anxiety so that it doesn’t stop you from living. Lots of things make us feel afraid. Being afraid of some things – like fires – can keep you safe. What you’re afraid of and how you act when you’re afraid of something can be different for every person. Knowing what makes you afraid and why can be the first step to overcoming anxiety. Manage and reduce stress: How can we manage and reduce stress? - our free downloadable pocket guide offers you 101 tips. Because anxiety is a type of fear, the things we’ve described about fear above are also true for anxiety. The word ‘anxiety’ tends to be used to describe worry, or when fear persists over time, often without any one cause. Anxiety is when fear is about something in the future or something that might happen, rather than what is happening right now. Anxiety is a word often used by health professionals when they’re describing persistent fear. The ways that you feel when you’re frightened and anxious are very similar, as the basic emotion is the same. When you feel frightened or seriously anxious, your mind and body work very quickly. These are some of the things that might happen: These things occur because your body, sensing fear, is preparing you for an emergency. It makes your blood flow to the muscles, increases blood sugar, and gives you the mental ability to focus on the thing that your body perceives as a threat. With anxiety, in the longer term, you may have some of the above symptoms as well as a more nagging sense of fear. You may get irritable, have trouble sleeping, develop headaches, or have trouble getting on with work and planning for the future; you might have problems having sex, and might lose self-confidence. Early humans needed the fast, powerful responses that fear causes, as they were often in situations of physical danger. However, we no longer face the same threats in modern-day living. Despite this, our minds and bodies still work in the same way as our early ancestors, and we have the same reactions to our modern worries about paying the bills, work, and social situations. But we can’t run away from or physically attack these problems! The physical feelings of fear can be scary in themselves – especially if you are experiencing them and you don’t know why, or if they seem out of proportion to the situation. Instead of alerting you to a danger and preparing you to respond to it, your fear or anxiety can kick in for any perceived threat, which could be imaginary or minor. This can cause you more problems than whatever triggered the reaction in the first place. Fear may be a one-off feeling when you are faced with something unfamiliar. But it can also be an everyday, long-lasting problem – even if you can’t put your finger on why. Some people feel a constant sense of anxiety all the time, without any particular trigger. There are plenty of triggers for fear in everyday life, and you can’t always work out exactly why you are frightened or how likely you are to be harmed. Even if you can know how out of proportion a fear is, the emotional part of your brain keeps sending danger signals to your body. Sometimes you need mental and physical ways of tackling fear and anxiety. A panic attack is when you feel overwhelmed by the physical and mental feelings of fear – the signs are listed under ‘What do fear and anxiety feel like?’. People who have panic attacks say that they find it hard to breathe, and they may worry that they’re having a heart attack or are going to lose control of their body. If you are experiencing symptoms like these, you should speak to a healthcare professional urgently to ensure there are no other underlying causes. A phobia is an extreme fear of a particular animal, thing, place, or situation. People with phobias have an overwhelming need to avoid any contact with the specific cause of the anxiety or fear. The thought of coming into contact with the cause of the phobia makes you anxious or panicky. Fear and anxiety is something that we will all experience now and then. It is only when it is severe and long-lasting that it can become a mental health problem. If you feel anxious all the time for several weeks, if it feels like your fears or phobias are taking over your life, or if you’re experiencing panic attacks, it’s a good idea to ask your doctor for help. Alternatively, try one of the websites or numbers listed at the bottom of this page. If you always avoid situations that scare you, it might stop you from doing things you want or need to do, making you miss out on life. This means you won’t be able to test whether the situation is as bad as you expect, so you also miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety. You can try setting yourself small, achievable goals for facing your fears. Try to learn more about your fear or anxiety. Keep an anxiety diary to note down how you’re feeling, what causes you to feel anxious, and what happens. When you understand how anxiety affects you, you’ll be better able to manage the feelings. You could carry with you a list of things that help at times when you are likely to become frightened or anxious. This can be an effective way of addressing the underlying beliefs that are behind your anxiety. It’s very common to feel silly or even ashamed of fears and anxieties. This can lead us to hide what’s going on from those we are close to. But there’s no need for us to feel this way and you don’t have to overcome your anxieties alone! If you have a friend or family member you feel confident will respond in a supportive way, it can often feel better to open up about what’s going on. The act of talking about something can help reduce your anxiety levels and encourage you to get more support if needed. Try to increase the amount of physical activity you do. Exercise requires some concentration, and this can take your mind off your fear and anxiety. Remember, activity doesn’t have to be vigorous; gentle stretches, seated exercises, or walking are all good for you. Learning relaxation techniques can help you with the mental and physical feelings of fear. It can help just to drop your shoulders and breathe deeply. Or imagine yourself in a relaxing place. You could also try complementary therapies or exercise such as massage, t’ai chi, yoga, mindfulness techniques, or meditation. Close your mouth and quietly breath in through your nose, counting to four in your head. Hold your breath and count to seven. Breathe out through your mouth, making a whoosh sound while counting to eight. Repeat three more times for a total of four breath cycles. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables and try to avoid eating too much sugar as resulting dips in your blood sugar can give you anxious feelings. Try to avoid drinking too much tea and coffee, as caffeine can also increase anxiety levels. It’s very common for people to drink when they feel nervous. Some people call alcohol ‘Dutch courage’, but it’s not good for you and the after-effects of alcohol can make you feel even more afraid or anxious. If you are religious or spiritual, this can give you a way of feeling connected to something bigger than yourself. Faith can provide a way of coping with everyday stress, and attending places of worship and other faith groups can connect you with a valuable support network. Talking therapies, like counselling or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), are very effective for people with anxiety problems. This includes Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CCBT), which takes you through a series of self-help exercises on screen. Contact your GP to find out more. Drug treatments are used to provide short-term help, rather than looking at the root of the anxiety problems. Drugs may be most useful when they are combined with other treatments or support. You can learn a lot about managing anxiety from asking other people who have experienced it. Local support groups or self-help groups bring together people with similar experiences so that they can hear each other’s stories, share tips, and encourage each other to try out new ways to manage feelings of anxiety. Your doctor, library, or local Citizens Advice bureau will have details of support groups near you. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see our get help page for support. Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear. We all feel anxious sometimes, but anxiety may be a mental health problem if your feelings are very strong or last a long time. A panic attack is a feeling of sudden and intense fear. It can come on quickly and for no apparent reason. Panic attacks can be very frightening, but they’re not dangerous. Anxiety is a type of fear usually associated with the thought of a threat or something going wrong in the future, but can also arise from something happening right now. In this report, we explore anxiety and understand the role that it plays in our lives, for better and for worse. \n",

      " When we are afraid of something, whether it's a fear of dogs or public speaking, it can be tempting to avoid it. Although this might bring relief in the short term, avoiding situations can make them harder to face up to and mean that our fears grow. If instead we gradually expose ourselves to situations we fear, we can start to overcome them and feel more in control. This is sometimes called exposure therapy. These 6 steps can help you to try this out for yourself. The tips in this video will guide you through a process to help you gradually face and learn to overcome your fears in a structured, strategic way. When we are faced with our fear it can be hard to figure out what is really going on. When you are feeling more relaxed, take some time to think about the way you feel physically when you are afraid and how this makes you behave. For example, if you fear taking public transport, you might notice that you feel panicked, hot and shaky. Or maybe you think about what could go wrong, so you get off before your stop or you avoid public transport altogether. Understanding why we feel a certain way can make it easier to manage things when we become afraid. You may already know that the physical and emotional symptoms of fear can actually help to keep us safe in dangerous situations by making us more alert to potential threats or preparing our bodies for action. This is the \"fight or flight\" response. For some of us, this response may be heightened or over-sensitive, which can lead to feelings of fear in situations that are not really dangerous, like when taking public transport or travelling in a lift for example. The best way to overcome this fear is not to avoid these activities but to gradually expose yourself to them. Think about which situations involve your fear and how difficult each one is to face. Try rating them from 0 to 100, with 0 being not difficult at all and 100 causing the most fear. For example, taking the bus for a couple of stops with a friend might be a 10, but taking the bus for a couple of stops on your own might score 50. Make a list of these situations in order of the least to most difficult. Now you have rated your situations, you can begin working through them. Starting with the lowest-scoring (least-difficult) one, begin facing your fears by putting yourself in the situation that you find uncomfortable. This will likely be tough at first but do your best to stick at it and confront the difficulty. Carry on putting yourself in the situation until you rate your fear as having reduced by half. So if it scored 10 on your list to start with, keep going until you would rate it a 5. You should notice that the more times you face a fear, the less scary it becomes. When confronting your fears, it's important to allow yourself to feel worried or scared without relying on distractions. This can help prove to yourself you are able to cope. So if there are things you would normally do to distract yourself – like playing with your phone or seeking reassurance from others – try to face the situation without doing these. You might still want to run away from your fear when you first try this technique, but it will get easier as you keep going. Once your fear has reduced by half, you can move on to the next situation on your list. Over time you will be able to work your way through each one and gradually overcome your fears. This may take some time to do, especially when you begin reaching the more difficult situations, so do not be discouraged if some things take longer than others. Remember that every time you put yourself in a situation you find difficult, no matter how big or small, it's a step towards reducing your anxiety, feeling more in control and overcoming your fears. It might feel like a relief to avoid things when we're not feeling our best, but this can make a low mood harder to shift. See some tips you can try to tackle your tasks, build more structure into your life and find a better balance. Find more ideas to try in self-help CBT techniques © Crown copyright\n",

      "Aquaphobia, or a fear of water, can translate into a fear of swimming and a fear of drowning. These are common fears that affect thousands of people around the world. Being afraid to get in the water, however, can put a damper on your summer. If you or your child is trying to overcome a fear of swimming, there are safe and effective ways to do so. We’ve included a few helpful tips below. People often fear what they don’t understand. Learning how swimming works, including the principles of buoyancy, can help you demystify drowning and take some of the fear out of the process. The more you know about swimming, the less you’ll fear drowning. You’ll have a better chance of controlling your anxiety if you know at least the basics of how buoyancy works. A simple internet search can help you learn about swimming. Learn about deep-breathing and relaxation techniques as well to help you stay calm when trying to swim. “Jumping into the deep end” isn’t a good method when it comes to overcoming your fear of swimming. It’s better to take some things slow. Start in the shallow end, getting your feet wet and gradually walking deeper. Splash some water on your face and think of positive images to associate water with something you enjoy. Work with a professional swim coach or at least a buddy who knows how to swim so that you’re not on this journey alone. It’s easier to get comfortable in the water with someone you know and trust with you. If you feel yourself start to get anxious or panicky, take a moment to breathe and relax. Stand up or hold onto the pool ladder and take your time quelling your stress. Picture a happy place where you feel safe. Never be afraid or embarrassed to ask for a break or for a flotation device while learning how to swim. Do what makes you feel comfortable, safe, and in control of the situation. Don’t let anyone rush you. For most people, fear of swimming is actually a fear of drowning. Learn how to conquer this fear by getting comfortable holding your breath underwater. Don’t worry – you can start while standing up in shallow water. Bend down to submerge your face, taking a deep breath as you go under. Stay for as long or as short a time as you’re comfortable with. Continue submerging just your head and face until you feel confident in going completely underwater. Find out a few best practices for how to breathe while swimming and start practicing those. Most people are naturally buoyant and find it easy to float on their backs in the water. This is a good skill to learn, as it can become your go-to if you start to feel tired, scared, or anxious while you swim. Floating takes no energy once you learn how to do it, so it will not tire you out. Your face is safely out of the water while you float. You’ll have the choice to catch your breath and continue swimming, backstroke to shore, or keep floating until someone comes to help. If you want to cool off this summer by swimming, conquer your fears with help from a professional swim instructor. Find a swim class near you to help you feel more confident in the water. A professional can guide you through all the steps to learning how to swim, as well as help you overcome your phobias. Be upfront with your instructor about your fears and find someone you feel completely comfortable with in the water.

      " When we think about fear, it is most often attributed to feelings of unease or anxiousness, a feeling that arises in response to something that our brains perceive as dangerous or that makes us feel unsafe. In the larger emotional reaction that is fear, there are a few different factors that come into play. There are rational and irrational fears, there is fear of the unknown, there is fear of certain situations, among others. What’s more, there are a multitude of ways to deal with fear: there is embracing fear, accepting fear as well as overcoming fear- and you’ll most likely need to employ a variety of techniques in order to do all three of these things. All of us have fears and we must all work to accept, embrace and overcome them in order to release control, learn from failure, and grow as human beings. Use the tips below to help you manage your fears and become a stronger, more powerful version of yourself. Before you are able to accept, embrace, or even overcome fear, the first step is to acknowledge that it exists. Put words to your emotions and say them out loud or write down what it is you fear. There are so many factors to our everyday life and existence as human beings that we just cannot control and yet they are still common sources of fear and anxiety. If you take the time to accept that you have no control over these things, you can limit the power they have over you. Where is the fear coming from? Where and when did it start? Embracing or overcoming your fears means sitting down with your thoughts, even meditating if possible, and digging a little deeper into the sources of those fears. It will not only help you learn a little more about yourself but you may find that the fear isn’t as strong or scary as you once thought it was. \n",
      "Being mindful\n",
      " is the ability to practice the power of being fully present and being in control of your own experience. You can use the power of being mindful to focus on the emotions and feelings behind your fears, acknowledging them when they crop up - in a non-judgemental way - and take a step back with the intention of understanding those feelings and thoughts in order to embrace the fear itself. Positivity is a superpower! Directing your brain to positive thoughts not only takes the focus off of the fear, it also helps reinforce your feelings of safety, of being loved and accepted, and can even help your problem solving skills. Being positive can help you both accept the fear as well as overcome it as you use your rational brain to bring fears into perspective. Visualization involves imagining our deepest ambitions and goals as true and already in existence, thereby enabling our subconscious mind to cement this new reality as the actual one. This comes in handy when it comes to overcoming fear as you can visualize yourself in the exact situation that you fear, and create the reality of fearlessness. Visualization doesn’t need to be solely in your mind either - you can journal out this reality, make a vision board, or include positive affirmations to place yourself above and outside the reach of your fears. Movement to the rescue once again! Exercise is a way to not only quiet your mind and quell the fearful feelings but also pump you up with the help of some happy endorphins. You’ll reap the mental benefits, too- like increased creativity and improved decision making. Movement could be anything that makes you happy, from a sweaty HIIT session or a quick walk around the block, to some gentle stretching or a bike ride. No matter the fearful scenario you find yourself in, taking time to care for your mind, body and soul through self-care practices can help you put fears in their place and release any anxiety and stress they are causing. Self-care practices are as wide and varied as each of our personalities and the method you choose will depend entirely upon you. All that matters is you make time for you. Contact Information \n",

      "You know what it’s like to be afraid of something, whether it be thunderstorms, a trip to the dentist, a stranger at your door, or losing someone dear to you. Fear is a normal reaction that warns our bodies to be careful. Anxiety is a type of fear, dealing more with worry and the future, rather than fearing something that is present. When fear and anxiety become a pattern in our lives, they become a problem. If your plugged drain in the kitchen sink is a problem, do you ignore it? Of course not. You call a plumber or try to fix it yourself. When fearfulness causes harm to your physical and mental stability, and you find yourself avoiding things that might create more fear, don’t ignore it. When anxiety becomes a debilitating thing that leaves you cowering and sick, don’t try to push it away. Learn how to overcome fear and anxiety.  The following 6 steps may be your ticket to getting rid of fear and anxiety disorders in your life. This first step can be the hardest one, but it’s also absolutely necessary. You can’t overcome a fear that remains hidden in the dusty regions of your subconscious. You must face it. When you turn your face toward a person, you see that person and learn what he looks like and how he is acting. When you turn toward your fear (rather than away from it), you notice things about your fear that you didn’t know before. This awareness helps you overcome it. To help yourself face your fears and anxiety, try keeping a journal over a period of two or three weeks. Record any patterns you notice. Do your hands turn clammy and your stomach clenches when you hear the doorbell? Do you experience more symptoms of anxiety in the morning or the evening? What do you tend to do when your fears arise? Jot down anything that seems significant. Transferring your fear patterns and symptoms into writing can help demystify them. They are no longer so big and insurmountable. Most importantly, learning all about your fear gives you an idea of how to counter it. An imagination is a wonderful thing. It gives you power, creativity, and the ability to think outside the box. Unfortunately, an active imagination can be a harmful tool when it causes you to think about negative things. Your imagination can magnify your fears, making your situation seem much worse than it actually is. Instead of letting your imagination lead you down the dark corridors of fear, purposely use it for overcoming fear. How do you do that? Pick a calm moment when you are relaxed and not anxious. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a situation that normally causes fear. For instance, if you are afraid of being lost in a crowded building, picture yourself in a busy airport. Now, imagine yourself handling the situation peacefully. You don’t freeze and begin to cry. Instead, you search for an information desk or a sign that will help you regain your sense of direction. You imagine yourself reaching the correct parking lot, unlocking your car door, and driving safely home without any bad incidents. The peace you experienced in your imagined scenario can actually help you get through the actual ordeal more peacefully. Your fear and anxiety arise out of a certain part of your brain, and they allow emotion to overcome rational thought. When you feel your fearful symptoms coming forth, try to use a different part of your brain. Think about numbers, for instance. A nurse in the clinic might ask a patient to rate his pain on a scale of 1-10. Use this scale for your anxiety. How anxious are you when 1 is perfectly calm and 10 is your very worst symptom? Stop and analyze. Do you rate your fear at 7? Very good. You can work on lowering that to a 4 or a 3. Try using the next step to lower your fear rating. Breathing is more important than you think. Usually, anxiety begins with short breaths. The short breaths cause a number of negative reactions in your body which quickly become an anxiety attack. The key to overcoming those fast outbreaks of anxiety is to control your breathing. Fortunately, deep breathing is not complicated. Once you have recognized that you are becoming fearful, stop and focus on your breathing. Take a breath in, and then slowly let it out. Make sure your exhale is longer than your inhale. This isn’t just some psychological trick; deep breathing forces your body to physically calm itself. You’ve heard about mindfulness, but what exactly is it? Mindfulness is a passive thinking activity that allows you to become more aware of your fear. As you learned in Step 1, awareness helps you overcome your fear and anxiety. Practice these mindfulness tips during some of your less severe times of fear and anxiety. When you recognize your fear symptoms arising, sit down and think about what is happening to you. This is like making a mental journal entry. Observe the symptoms as they arise. Don’t do anything about it. Just sit and keep track of yourself as the moment continues. Being passive raises your self-awareness, and it prevents you from doing the typical things you do when you experience fear. It helps get you out of a rut. Talking to a therapist is an excellent way to work through your fears and anxiety. However, you can’t always be at your therapist’s office. Try going for a walk outside instead! Natural beauty found in parks, backyards, or wherever something green is growing does help reduce symptoms of fear and anxiety. Nature calms people, reducing stress levels and changing moods from anxious to relaxed. Plus, the physical activity of walking or jogging outdoors requires us to use our brains differently, which can cause a switch from irrational fearful thoughts to clearer thinking that can help overcome the fear.

Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test  Jump to section What are fear and anxiety? What’s the difference between fear and anxiety? The effects of fear and anxiety Explaining concepts around fear and anxiety 7 steps to help you overcome your fears and anxiety How do you know if you need help? The saying goes “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” — but there’s a lot of scary things out there. Knowing how to overcome fear and anxiety is crucial. While managing our fear and anxiety well — and knowing the difference between the two — is important to our mental health and career success. Back when we lived in caves, we needed to constantly assess whether we were safe. A highly-tuned sensitivity to potential threats was necessary for survival. We don’t experience the same kinds of stressors as we did thousands of years ago, but the response is pretty much the same. Fear is the emotion we experience when we see a threat to our physical well-being or emotional well-being. Our bodies — and brains — react to both kinds of threats in the same way. In other words, it makes no difference whether the threat is a physical, emotional, or social one. The alarm bells of the autonomic nervous system don’t distinguish between public speaking and a saber-toothed tiger. In fact, many of us would prefer the latter. Although unpleasant, fear is a healthy response. Our fight-or-flight response keeps us alive, safe, and thriving. When constant fear prevents you from living life to the fullest, though, it becomes anxiety. On the surface, anxiety looks very much like fear. And they're rooted in the same emotion. But anxiety occurs when fear becomes maladaptive (the psychological term for when a normal response gets out of control). Anxiety is when the fear response goes haywire. You may feel afraid all the time, overreact, or respond to triggers that don’t actually pose a threat. While fear is something that people experience regularly, anxiety should not be a part of your day-to-day life (easier said than done for most). Fear is an emotion, and anxiety is a mental health disorder. The symptoms of fear go away on their own when the threat dissipates. Symptoms of anxiety, however, persist and often must be managed with medication and therapy.  Fear symptoms and anxiety symptoms overlap in many ways, but the reasons they occur are different. Both fear and anxiety trigger the body’s stress response. However, fear usually occurs in the face of a “real” or immediate, tangible threat, while anxiety occurs in response to imagined danger. Fear is a (generally) short-lived reaction, while anxiety can be ever-present. Both share physical sensations, like racing heart, muscle tension, a tingle or a cold chill, and increased breathing rate. These physical sensations are part of the body’s fight-or-flight response. They prepare you to take quick action by diverting your resources to necessary functions.  Sign up to receive our latest content, tools, and resources. Thank you for your interest in BetterUp. Fear and anxiety often overlap. As noted above, they share many of the same symptoms. But someone that has anxiety will have a more sensitive fear trigger. Even situations that don’t present an immediate threat may cause feelings of fear. For example, imagine that you are in an office and see a group of coworkers chatting casually. This stimulus is fairly innocuous. However, if you have anxiety, you may begin to experience racing thoughts, nervousness, and have trouble saying hello to them. Do your coworkers pose a threat? In this case, yes. There is no immediate threat or inherent danger — your colleagues aren’t about to run you over or attack you (probably). But if you, say, are concerned that they may be talking about you, you’re responding to the perceived threat. Your response is appropriate for what might happen, not what’s happening now. So what’s wrong with that? People gossip, right? And weren’t they probably talking about you? You wouldn’t feel this way unless it were true, right? Not so fast. We assume that our emotions are “triggered” in response to a certain stimulus. In other words, we react to whatever is happening around us, and we trust our emotions to give us feedback on what we see. However, that’s not true. Remember the fight-or-flight response? It’s not really a response — well, not a response to the stimulus, that is. Emotion researcher Lisa Feldman Barrett says that the brain uses sensory input to predict what will happen next. Based on its prediction, the brain generates a physical response, which we read as emotion.  Why this extra step? Through our experiences and learning, your brain has gotten quite good at predicting. It’s helpful because a reactive brain would be too slow to get you out of danger efficiently. However, when we’ve gotten used to “predicting” (read: interpreting) everything as a threat, our anxiety levels are high all the time. There’s no actual threat, but there are so many things that might happen to worry about.  Our body’s response to fear is to activate the sympathetic nervous system — whether the threat is real or imagined. This evolved to work as a short-term boost to get us out of danger and isn’t well suited for managing vague, continued threats. Over time, fear and anxiety can have adverse effects on the mind, emotions, and body. Mind Emotion Body When people talk about fear and anxiety, they often use the words interchangeably. But there’s a whole range of experiences on the anxiety spectrum. In fact, the DSM-5 actually classifies anxiety as a subset of mood disorders, and there are several different kinds. Learning to label the experience may help you feel better able to control it. Here are some common terms used to describe fear and anxiety: Anxiety disorder  The term anxiety disorder refers to a classification of mental health diagnoses that result in anxiety symptoms. These include phobias and panic attacks. They also include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety disorders have basic symptoms in common but can differ in severity. Panic attacks A panic attack usually happens suddenly and without a specific trigger. Whereas many symptoms of anxiety are mental, panic attacks are notable for strong physical sensations. In fact, many people having panic attacks believe that they are experiencing a heart attack. During a panic attack, people often feel an overwhelming sense of dread and as if they're about to die. It is difficult to function through a panic attack. Despite the severity of panic symptoms, it is not always possible to tell that someone is having a panic attack by looking at them. Phobias Phobias are panic responses that occur in response to a specific stimulus. Typically the person experiencing the panic attack will be able to name what caused it. They have likely had phobia attacks before. The responses to these phobias can range from mild to debilitating. In order to classify as a true phobia, the aversion has to result in impairment to their daily life. People with phobias sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the trigger. Managing fear and anxiety isn’t always easy. However, you can build your skills in managing your emotional response. Developing self-awareness is a great first step in overcoming your fears and anxiety. Here are 7 steps to learn how to overcome fear and anxiety at work: 1. Notice how you feel Not everyone is good at talking about their emotions. Being able to identify your anxiety is a helpful first step. What sensations clue you into your emotional state? Do you have trouble breathing, sweaty palms, or a stomachache? Practice reading that as a physical cue instead of being carried away by it. 2. Own the fear Have you ever been on the verge of tears and tried to stop them from coming? It’s extremely difficult. Trying to ignore your fearful thoughts is just as hard. Stop wasting emotional energy trying to be okay. That energy is better used to reach out for help. 3. Breathe Even though “take a deep breath” is probably not what you want to hear, there’s a reason why it works. Deep and mindful breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system. Breathing, mindfulness meditation, and other relaxation techniques deactivate the body’s stress response. 4. Check in with yourself again  How are you feeling now, and what is the next best step to take? Should you take a walk? Do you need to remove yourself from your current situation or reach out to someone? This is an interim measure to give yourself a chance to choose the response that best serves you. 5. Handle your basic biological needs Your body only has so many physiological sensations, so it’s easy to confuse them. Your brain may interpret a fluttering sensation in the stomach as love or stage fright. What if it’s just hunger? Drink a glass of water and eat something (preferably with some nutritional value). Do you still feel anxious? 6. Take your negative thoughts to trial Ask yourself, “What am I afraid of? Is it happening right now or is it an imagined threat?” If you have the time, talk through your fearful thoughts or write out what happened and how you feel. Then imagine a response that makes you feel empowered. 7. Get back in the arena Now that you have a clearer understanding of why you feel how you feel, decide the best course of action. Do you need to have a conversation with someone? Is there an action you need to take? Don’t procrastinate. Lingering tasks have a way of producing more anxiety. Being proactive will help you feel more in control and boost your self-confidence, both now and in future stressful situations. Sometimes, it’s not possible to manage your anxiety problems by yourself — and that’s okay. If you’ve tried the above steps with no luck (or they just feel like too much), reach out to a coach or counselor. As mentioned earlier, learning how to manage fear and anxiety is a natural part of life. The fear response was evolved to help us. But it becomes maladaptive when it interferes with your ability to function. Your anxiety symptoms may be more than you can manage alone if: If any of these statements are true, reach out to a mental health professional for support. Anxiety is often managed by a combination of medication and cognitive psychotherapy. Neither intervention has to be forever. A therapist will work with you to manage the immediate symptoms. Joining a support group can give you insight into others' experiences overcoming fear. The goal is to improve your overall state of being while you learn how to naturally overcome anxiety in your daily life. Learning how to overcome fear and anxiety takes self-awareness and strength — and a healthy dose of courage. You don’t have to manage it alone. A coach or counselor can help you master the skills to overcome anxiety and fear.

      "Even though we’ve been dealing with COVID-19 for a few months now, most of us still aren’t used to it. You may not fully understand what it even is, or maybe it feels impossible to make sure you and your loved ones will stay safe. It’s totally normal to be a bit scared right now, but just because it’s normal doesn’t mean it feels good.  Fear is one of the basic emotions that everyone feels at one point or another. We often feel fear when we sense a threat—real or imaginary. It can be a really uncomfortable feeling and may even make it hard for you to think about anything else.  It may not seem like it, but fear can actually be a good thing! Being scared is usually what makes us act in ways that protect us. Think about it—if you weren’t afraid of catching COVID-19, you probably wouldn’t follow the rules of washing your hands for 20 seconds or wearing a mask. You might not enjoy feeling fear, but it serves an important purpose right now, so don’t ignore it. Fear becomes a bad thing when you can’t stop thinking about what scares you or if it’s interrupting your daily activities. If you’re in full-on panic mode, it’s important to take some steps to help reduce your level of fear to better fit the situation we’re facing.  You can’t change the fact that we’re living in a pandemic or the effects of COVID-19, but you can control how much the fear that comes with it impacts you. Sometimes the hardest thing about feeling afraid is that you don’t know what to do to change it. If that sounds familiar, here are some things you can do to help yourself:   Talk to a trusted adult. If you’re a bit lost on how to handle this whole situation, check in with an adult about how you’re feeling. This could be a parent, teacher, coach, or someone else you trust. Whether you don’t quite know what COVID-19 is and how to stay safe, or you’re worried about starting a new school year virtually or in-person, an adult can help calm your fears and give you tips to stay healthy and comfortable.  Limit your screen time. While it’s important to understand what’s happening in the world, there’s such thing as too much information. Constant news coverage might make you feel more scared of COVID-19, and social media can be full of false information and worst-case scenarios. Unfollow or mute social media accounts if they’re constantly upsetting you. If you see a story or statistic that worries you, bring it up to someone who can help you talk it out. Remind yourself of ways to stay safe. Even though things seem scary right now, there are a lot of ways to keep yourself safe—and you’re probably already doing most of them! Washing your hands regularly, wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large groups are all ways to reduce your risk of infection. Remind yourself of these things and challenge yourself to think of more reasons to not worry.   Take some deep breaths. Focusing on your breathing is a great way to relax and reduce some of the anxiety you may be feeling. When you feel big emotions, you might notice you start to breathe faster. If you work to slow your breathing, it signals to your brain that it’s time to calm down. Try 4-7-8 breathing: breathe in for four seconds, hold for seven seconds, and breathe out for eight seconds.  Keep having fun. It’s important to still participate in activities you enjoy, even if they’re a bit different right now. Maybe you can play a game with your family or have a virtual movie night with some friends. You could also do a craft or a puzzle or start a new book. You should do these things regularly, but they can be especially helpful to distract yourself if you’re having a moment of serious fear.  Maintain healthy behaviors. Keeping up healthy habits is really important. Handwashing is important to curb the spread of COVID-19, but things like eating healthy food, getting some exercise, spending time outside, and getting a good night’s sleep (9-12 hours if you are 6-12 years old, or 8-10 hours if you are 13-18 years old) impact your health too. And if you do happen to get sick, these habits will help your immune system be ready to fight off those germs.  Stick to a routine. It’s normal to be scared of uncertainty, and COVID-19 has added some uncertainty to almost all parts of life. You can help reduce the impacts of this by adding some structure to your days. Make a schedule for yourself—try to eat your meals, do your schoolwork, move your body, and go to bed and wake up at the same times each day. This can help you feel more in control and prepared to take on the challenges you’re facing.  If you still feel overwhelmed, unable to cope and as though your fear is affecting how you function every day, you may be experiencing the first signs of a mental health condition, like depression or anxiety.  Take the youth screen at MHAScreening.org to see if you may be at risk.

      "Treating your phobias might seem daunting, but it’s worth it if you’re ready. As kids, facing our fears is often a rite of passage. We learned there were no monsters under the bed or danger in the basement. As we get older, facing our fears can become more complicated. But you don’t always have to overcome your fears — we obviously wouldn’t want to lose our fear of a speeding car or other real dangers. Fear is a basic human emotion designed to motivate us to avoid danger, explains Seth Gillihan, PhD, a clinical psychologist and the author of The CBT Deck for Anxiety, Rumination, and Worry. A physiological arousal happens — what’s called the fight-or-flight response — that energizes you to move away from the threat. Physiological changes triggered by fear include rapid heartbeat, redirection of blood flow away from the periphery toward the gut, and tensing of the muscles, according to the definition of fear from the American Psychological Association (APA). RELATED: How Stress Affects the Body “Fear signals that there is danger and is a universal emotion experienced all over the world,” says Robin Stern, PhD, the senior advisor of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence in New Haven, Connecticut, and a codeveloper of an approach to emotional learning program called RULER (recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, regulating). Fear is related but not synonymous with phobia or anxiety, Dr. Stern explains. With anxiety, it’s the not knowing what’s going to happen that triggers the emotional response, she says. Phobias are also different, says Dr. Gillihan, as they generally aren’t based on a present danger. The APA defines phobias as persistent and irrational fears of a specific situation, object, or activity, like heights or blood. Scientists agree that both genetics and environmental factors like learned habits and experiences have a role in why we develop specific fears and phobias, according to the APA. One meta-analysis assessed 10 studies on phobias and found evidence of “moderate heritability,” meaning there was some degree of genetic similarities between relatives who share a phobia. But the relationship between genes and environment is complicated. Phobias can often be traced to a specific incident, too — a dog bite leading to fear of dogs for example, says Gillihan. What’s important to know is if and when you want to face your fears, there are steps you can take to do so. You need to feel ready to make that decision, says Gillihan. If you happen to fear something you can generally avoid like a giant tarantula, you may not feel a strong urge to face your fear, and that’s okay too. “It’s always a cost-benefit analysis,” he says. The question is how much is this phobia interfering with your life? When you’re afraid of something you can’t easily avoid (like an elevator), or if avoiding the thing you fear puts you at risk (like getting a shot at the doctor), there are clear benefits of facing that fear. “It’s always up to the person whether they want to face that fear.” But be honest with yourself, Gillihan adds: “Fear tends to grow when we avoid things.” There are other situations where facing a fear may not work to your advantage, Stern says. Such might be the case if you have a toxic boss or you’re in an abusive relationship. Confronting the abuser to try to face that fear might bring you harm — and might not bring you any benefit, she says. In those cases, you will likely benefit most from avoiding harm until you can get yourself out of the situation, she says. Here are tips from Gillihan and Stern when it comes to facing your fears: Judging yourself negatively for being afraid of something is not going to help you face that fear. Instead, consider practicing reframing how you look at that fear, says Stern. Rather than thinking of being afraid as good or bad, consider it information your body is telling you, she explains. Then assess what value that information has and what to do about it. RELATED: Tips for Showing Yourself Some Self-Compassion Stern helped develop a method called the “meta-moment.” To do it, pause and take a deep breath, which helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, the system in your body that is responsible for rest, sleeping, and enjoyment, among other things. It’s the body’s calmed down (rather than active) state. When the parasympathetic system is activated, you’re more likely to be able to think clearly and face your fear. Don’t rush your breath. Stern says, “If you try to breathe from high up in your chest, it’s not going to be as effective,” as compared with slow, deep belly breaths. You can even put your hand on your belly and watch it go up and down to direct the breath into the belly. RELATED: How to Practice Breath-Focused Meditation Another way to face your fears is to try to be what Stern calls an “emotion scientist.” Listen and be curious about what’s driving you to be afraid of something, rather than shutting down or ignoring it. Learn where that fear is coming from, Stern says. You might see a new way to face those fears, or you might realize there’s less to be afraid of than you thought. “Instead of being impatient, replace that negative self-talk with positive self-talk,” says Stern. Tell yourself: “I’ve got this. I’m going to get this. I’ve been here before, and I can do this.” Exposure therapy is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that’s highly effective for treating specific fears and phobias. Patients gradually and incrementally face what they fear over time in a relatively safe place. It’s critical that you feel ready, Gillihan says. “It’s important for our brains to see that we are the ones who are choosing to confront what we’re afraid of,” he says. Research suggests that even a single session of therapy lasting four to six hours can be effective, says Gillihan. But if you can’t afford therapy, you can even use self-guided cognitive behavior therapy books or workbooks, he adds. Medications can be helpful in treating specific fears and phobias, though it’s important to discuss these options with your doctor. For example, beta blockers have been prescribed as a treatment for performance anxiety. Benzodiazepines are sometimes prescribed for anxiety disorders, but Gillihan cautions that these are addictive and typically have a sedative effect. It can be hard to imagine the payoff, but Gillihan says that a real feeling of triumph and freedom comes from facing your fears, and that makes it all worth it. ”Once we decide to face what we’re afraid of, there’s almost nothing that can hold us back,” he says.

      " To stop being scared so much, take a second to think about whether your fear is coming from something you know is scary or just something that could be scary. For example, if you hear a bump in the night and think it’s a monster, ask yourself what other things could have made the noise, like a neighbor closing their car door or your cat knocking something over, since this is much more likely. You can also take some deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, which will help calm you down. If you’re still scared, tell your parent or teacher if something is scaring you, so they can help you deal with it. Don’t be embarrassed, since everyone gets scared sometimes!

Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test Understand Yourself Better:  Big 5 Personality Test  Jump to section Coming to terms with your fear of failure Start by asking yourself these 4 questions How to get over the fear of failure: 7 tips Conquering fear of failure at work Acceptance is key Failure is scary. When you put effort into a project, tell countless people about it, and spend sleepless nights trying to succeed, defeat can be crushing. But if you’re constantly afraid of a negative outcome, why bother pursuing anything? Your dream job could be off the table because the effort would feel meaningless if you fail. You might end a promising relationship because you fear pain if it doesn’t work out. In both of these cases, the potential of a bad outcome can keep you from pursuing something beautiful. Whether it’s at work or in life, it’s normal to be concerned about whether things will work out. In fact, according to this survey of more than 1,000 people, folks are more afraid of failing than they are of spiders, being home alone, and even ghosts.  But the anxiety can become debilitating if you let it. It’s important to be mindful of your fears and reframe them so they don’t negatively impact your life. Here’s our guide to help you overcome fear of failure. Fear of failing, clinically known as atychiphobia, is difficult to identify. It manifests through subconscious behaviors and thought patterns invisible to you.   And, to complicate things further, this fear is a self-fulfilling prophecy: you're so afraid of failure that it becomes the only possible outcome. It’s often accompanied by a fixed mindset and automatic negative thoughts. That negativity harms your confidence and increases self-doubt.  Then, when you inevitably do fall short, you confirm to yourself that your fear is valid. Let’s use a job interview as an example. If you don’t bother attending because you’re scared of failing, you simply ensure that you’ll never get the job. You then try to validate your choice by convincing yourself you didn’t deserve to or weren’t able to succeed in the first place.  And so, the cycle continues. The key to breaking this pattern is recognizing your behaviors. See if any of these resonate with you: If any of these resonate, it’s not too late to make some changes. But that’s easier said than done. Acknowledging your fear can be scary in itself. The anxiety becomes so familiar that hanging onto it feels safer than dealing with its underlying symptoms. It can often be a sign of shame, depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem — all of which can be hard to confront. It’s worth talking to a mental health professional if you need help navigating these conditions.  In milder cases, though, learning to reframe your thoughts can help. Don’t underestimate the power of positive thinking.  Next time you feel afraid, take a deep breath and write your thoughts in a journal. You can use these questions to prompt a different way of thinking:  Reading your answers can help you identify your fears, thought patterns, and limiting beliefs you weren’t aware of before. It can also make you feel less overwhelmed, allowing you to examine your fears objectively and plan a course of action. Once you’ve written your thoughts, work with BetterUp to unpack them. Our coaches can help you reframe your fears so they no longer hold power over you.  It’s one thing to identify your fears; it’s another to overcome them. Here are some tips that can help. There’s a reason why the expression “fail fast” has gained popularity in recent years. Business leaders know that accepting failure is a part of achieving success. Every mistake is a stepping stone toward a larger goal. No one starts a business with the intent to fail. But, if things go south, it better happen quickly. The sooner it’s over, the sooner you can learn from your mistakes and move on. There’s a first time for everything. Adopting a beginner's mind is about approaching new challenges with curiosity and positive thinking rather than fear. Look at every situation as a learning experience and give yourself permission to not be a pro immediately. Even Michael Jordan practiced before he became a success story. If you’re a perfectionist, you probably want to succeed in your first attempt. But this is an unrealistic expectation. You’ll encounter roadblocks, and that’s okay. Two small steps forward and one step back is still a net positive. When you're stuck in your own head, overthinking and overwhelm can kick in. Talking to someone you trust can help shed new light on your situation — whether that’s a friend, mentor, family member, or therapist. Tell them about your fears and listen to their feedback. They can change how you see things.   When you’re worried about a situation, it’s easy to fixate on one possible negative outcome. But until you’ve gone through with it, you don’t know how the story ends. You can’t predict the future. Consider the possibility that things turn out better than you think. Use your visualization skills to imagine multiple possible endings. This new project might lead to new industry connections, a deeper relationship with your boss and team, or more knowledge about your field. Or (and this is the best option of all), you might knock it out of the park. Until everything is said and done, anything is possible. In the words of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”  Living in fear comes at a cost. If you never try anything, you could miss out on some of life’s great opportunities. Remember that trying and failing is often better than not trying at all. Nothing is ever set in stone. If you try something and it's not what you expected, you're allowed to make changes. You can quit a job you don't like anymore, ask for help when you're overwhelmed, or extend your deadline if you need it. As long as you're willing to adapt, you're never truly stuck in a decision. Your fear may never really go away, and that’s okay. That doesn’t mean you have to let it control you. If bravery means progressing without fear, courage means doing it despite fear. Be courageous, and you’ll be surprised what you can accomplish.  Depending on your career, work can feel particularly high pressure. Here are some tips to help you conquer fear in the workplace. Many negative experiences have hidden benefits, even if you don’t see them instantly. Take a look at previous mistakes and how they influenced you. Perhaps an embarrassing typo made you more detail-oriented, or a missed deadline made you more efficient. These experiences might have hurt, but you persevered. You learned from those failures; you can learn from future ones, too. When there’s a higher risk of failure than normal, see it for the challenge it is. This is an opportunity to test your skills in a way you haven’t before.  Stepping out of your comfort zone is hard work and might be stressful at first — but not all stress is bad. Some people fear success because it means change. But if you’re up to the task, you can activate eustress and engage in some of the best work you’ve ever done. If things don’t go your way, remember to be kind to yourself. Self-care is vitally important when you don’t meet your own expectations. Go home, take a bath, hit the gym — whatever you need to relieve stress before hopping back on that horse.  No one likes to make mistakes. At best, they’re embarrassing. At worst, they affect your team members or loved ones. But they’re unavoidable. You can chase perfection all you want, but to err is to be human. The moment you stop making mistakes is when you stop growing in your life and career. Of course, not every risk is worth taking — you don't want to enter a situation that causes mental or physical harm. But many of life's opportunities involve a healthy challenge. Learning how to overcome fear of failure is easier said than done. But we believe you can do it — and we’re excited to see you thrive.

      "Suppressing your emotions because you’re afraid of them can be bad for your physical and mental health. Here’s what to do instead. When a toddler feels a “big” emotion, like anger or sadness, they tend to have a big tantrum on the floor. And these tantrums can be a lot to observe, full of thrashing, screaming, and tears. But a child reacts like this because the emotion they’re feeling is uncomfortable, maybe even painful. Of course, as adults, we feel emotions too, and those feelings can be just as overwhelming, uncomfortable, or even painful as they were when we were children, even if we don’t let ourselves react in such a big way.  But, sometimes, in our attempts to not give in to our emotions, we go too far: we run from them or suppress them — even if that harms us in the long run. Although there are many reasons we might suppress our emotions, one of them is that we are afraid of our emotions.  Fear of emotions is called “animotophobia. It is not an official term in the DSM-5-TR. Still, fearing your emotions can have a significant impact on your well-being.   “Individuals who fear emotions miss one of the best things of life: living,” says Noelia Leite, licensed psychotherapist, doctor of integrative mental health, and certified hypnotherapist. “People who are afraid of emotions survive; they do not live. Their fear stops them from living the best of their lives.” This can impact their relationships, their mental health, and even their physical health because it can lead to bursts of rage, isolation, and trouble connecting with others. It can also lead to long-term depression and anxiety.  “It causes so much unnecessary suffering,” says Kirsten Cantley, holistic psychotherapist. “I would compare it to high cholesterol and heart disease.” We when fear our emotions, we often suppress them. This can lead to long-term health complications or strains in our relationships.  “Suppressed emotions stay in the body and begin to create disease, from pains to immune disorders to IBS to name a few,” she continues. “It also takes a toll on your mental health [because] emotions always come out, whether an unacceptable outburst or acting in a passive-aggressive way.” If you’re afraid of your emotions, you might: People who fear their emotions may also often try to suppress them through avoidance behavior. “People sometimes go to great lengths to not feel,” says Cantley, “which can lead to self-medicating with alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, or [other addictive behavior.]” Often, explains Leite, “fear of emotions may be rooted in past traumas or a pattern of recurrent events such as physical, emotional, or spiritual abuse, traumatic events such as car accidents, loss of loved ones, or war experience.”  Sometimes, this past trauma is unresolved, making someone afraid to re-experience how they have felt before. Someone might not feel a sense of inner safety or get overwhelmed by their emotions — which causes them to try to suppress them rather than feel them. They may also entirely avoid situations that could bring up those difficult emotions.  Other times, “it can stem from childhood and how the role models handled their emotions,” explains Cantley. For example, psychotherapist Ronnie Adamowicz explains that it could come from parents who would shame or punish their child for expressing emotions. This may not lead to a person fearing their emotions immediately, but it could begin to shape a person’s beliefs on feelings and emotional expression. “If a child is scared, sad, or angry, and runs to their parents, only to be punished, the child will not feel safe to express their emotions.”  Ultimately, the best way to stop being afraid of your emotions is to slowly and gradually face them.  This is why going to therapy can be very helpful. Cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), using the technique of exposure therapy, may be particularly helpful for overcoming a fear of emotions.  “[Therapy] offers a safe space for clients to feel safe to express their emotions,” Adamowicz says. “This creates what we call a ‘corrective emotional experience.’” When we have a positive experience expressing our emotions in therapy, we may change our beliefs on the utility of emotions.  Because it can be difficult to talk about how an emotion feels, your therapist might also focus on having you describe your physical feelings, rather than your emotional ones.  “[We] have them describe if they notice any subtle feelings in their body as they become fearful of an emotion,” Adamowicz says. “The more they can talk about how it physically feels, the more they can actually be with the emotion.”  Your therapist will also work with you to help normalize your feelings and accept them as valid, rather than suppress them, by teaching you to be gentle and non-judgmental with yourself.  Practicing mindfulness through breathing techniques, meditation, guided imagery, and yoga can help you begin feeling more comfortable sitting with your thoughts and experiencing them without judgment.  Finally, you can also “befriend your fear,” says Adamowicz.  “Imagine you had a 5-year-old nephew who was scared,” he says. “What would you do? You wouldn’t walk right past and ignore them. But that’s exactly what we do with our own emotions.” “[You] need to slow down,” he continues, “Slow down. and stop, and pause, and say hello to the nephew who’s scared…or stop and pause to the part that is feeling fear. Be with the fear. Have a relationship with the fear… Listen to it. let it talk. There is so much wisdom in the emotion itself.” This means that once we can recognize that our emotions are sources of information, not irrational feelings we need to run away from, we can develop a relationship with our emotions. This can allow us to understand ourselves better and lead a more intentional life. Many people fear their emotions because emotions can feel unpleasant or scary. However, in reality, our emotions are vital for understanding who we are, what we want, and where we are going. The more we understand and embrace our emotions, the less they control us.  With therapy, it’s possible to become more comfortable with our emotions, rather than suppress them, and that can help reduce the chances of long-term impacts on our mental and physical wellbeing.

      "Login Login To me, being \"rich\" is not about money. It's about living with less fear. Now let me explain. We all have fear. If we didn't feel fear, we wouldn't be alive. But there's a big difference between having fear and being driven by your fears. Most people are driven by their fears, leading them to make (or avoid making) particular decisions that pull them down a dark, sticky dead-end road. Most of my life, I rode shotgun while my fear sat behind the wheel, steering me through life. I had fear of poverty. Fear of not being accepted. Fear of rejection. Fear of failure. Fear of abandonment. My relationship with my fear caused me to be a beta version of myself. I maneuvered at a very low frequency and, as a result, learned hat people don't really want to be around that. My feet were not planted in a particular stance. So I pretended. I scrambled. I let my fear inflate my insecurity and anxiety. Part One: You will always have fears, but when you get to a place where you are no longer driven by them, something magical happens. You become rich. You are in touch with your value. You feel powerful. Alive. Worthy. Anxiety lessens and potential increases, which means the chances of you also gaining financial traction increases as well as things fall into place. You become very potent. Are you driven by your fears? Are they stopping you from doing what you want or being who you want to be? The first step is owning your fears and then identifying them. Then, of course, the question becomes, \"How do I get rid of these fears?\" Well, for starters, here are three tips to no longer be driven by fear. 1. Notice your fears.  Everything starts with awareness. Think about all the fears that are stopping you from being happy. Just observe them. This process is actually incredibly freeing. Once you do that, recognize that your fears, despite seeming very powerful, are not concrete walls. They can be dismantled and are less powerful than you think ... 2. Admit that you are afraid of particular things.  Many people know what they are afraid of, but won't admit it, especially to themselves. This resistance will only give the fear more power. Denial means you're running instead of facing. Only when you admit what you are afraid of can you start dissolving your fears.  3. Decide you're sick of fear. Many therapists will try to encourage you to explore where your fears are coming from. It's true: they started somewhere, depending on your story. Often, they will ask questions intended to help you follow the fear all the way to its roots as a way to process it. Indeed, there is a therapeutic process to overcoming your fears which requires this kind of coaching. But you know what? At some point, you just have to make a choice to not be afraid anymore. At some point you have to decide to enter the arena. Yes, you can actually choose to be less afraid. No, this doesn't mean your fear is just going to go away. But it will move the ball. It will create a shift. Examine where your fears are taking you in your life and make a decision, now, to no longer allow those fears to drive your life. Part Two: Yes, today I still worry and stress and have fears. But I can honestly say I am no longer driven by them. And the results I see in my life by keeping fear from driving my decisions is the traction I need to continue growing stronger and more fearless. I am also not afraid of anyone, and I'm not saying in an arrogant way or that I'm better than anyone or physically stronger (because I'll be the first one to tell you I can't fight). I mean that I don't depend on other people to make me happy or make me feel valuable. Years ago, I truly thought others held the power to my happiness, a belief system that was born out of fear. A lot of times, we're afraid of people because we want something from them or expect from them that we may not get, especially when it comes to relationships. That's why I developed my video course How To Attract Your Soul Mate & Discover Your Life's Purpose to share what I've learned in my experience as a therapist about how letting go of fears allows us to tap into our power, and radiate inner strength and charismatic energy to the rest of the world. It is that energy that attracts others, not fearfully searching for another person to \"complete\" you. If you don't want anything from others other than an organic authentic connection, there's really nothing to be afraid of. Think about all the people in your life and who has power over you. Then ask yourself why this may be. It's usually because you care what they think, or because you believe they have the power to take something away from you. But really, no one can take away your truth (except for you). So what's the fastest way to reposition your life? Not allowing yourself to be driven by your fears. Not being afraid of people because you want something from them. When you are no longer afraid, you are completely free. If you want to be rich, stop playing the lottery and start working toward being be less afraid.

      "As a girl of ten years, satin ribbons in my hair, and wearing a freshly starched dress, I had a special seat in church each Sunday next to the most fearless person I knew: my father, Lawrence Manuel Jr. Each week, on Saturday evenings, in the rush of Los Angeles where I was born and raised, I would read my father his weekly Sunday school lesson. As I read, he would make symbols of his own in the margins that represented the sounds of the words. He did this because he was illiterate. A sharecropper's son born in 1898 in Opelousas, Louisiana, he spoke mostly Creole, making his English difficult to understand. Yet he didnât let that get in the way of his participation in Sunday school. With the symbols he had developed, he would âreadâ a portion of each lesson out loud to a class of other older black men. I would never have been brave enough to pull off such a thing. But my father was a talented and courageous man. Raised in the backwoods, he learned to do whatever was necessary to survive. He was what I called âfearless,â and, as I sat next to him at church, I prayed to be fearless just like him. On the other hand, it was also in church where my deepest fears emerged as a child. How was I going to negotiate my young life with God so that I would not go to hell? I was terrified. The stories my parents told of the South and race relations brought even more terror. And on an unforgettable night in 1966, right in Inglewood, California, a cross was burned on our front lawn. Why do I mention these things? I share them to demonstrate how fear and anxiety can accumulate over a lifespan. Most of us are unaware of the extent of the fear that we carry. Fear builds upon itself, or more precisely, fear creates more fear. As a result, our accumulated fear becomes a deep-seated terror that is challenging to uproot. We constantly speak of terrorism in the world, but we don't necessarily acknowledge the terror that has invaded our inner worlds.  Many of us are afraid of fear, and afraid of admitting, even to ourselves, that we feel it. We push back the visceral, embodied experience of fear so effectively we think we have eliminated the fear itself.  Or we try to eliminate the feeling of terror by rearranging our external lives like furniture in our house. If I changed the way I look, I'd be less afraid. If I had more money to maintain a particular appearance, I'd be less afraid. But all of these strategies are bound to fail. If we look around or within, we find that fear is often hidden and masked. The person who appears to be the \"center of the party\" might well be a person who fears her own invisibility or rejection. Perhaps the person who conducts eloquent presentations at the workplace is in fact afraid of losing his job. The longer we mask our fear the more we experience the terror of our inauthenticityâperhaps creating chronic anxiety and despair. Once, on the way to a television interview, fear rode my back like a monkey. Thoughts ran rapid, and each one amounted to \"I am not enough.\" In the guest room, I met a famous civil rights attorney waiting for his time to be interviewed. He smiled and assured me that all would go well. Clearly, he had seen my lack of breath and stiff movements. My terror was visible, and I was embarrassed. I realized in that moment that for most my life I had made great efforts at appearing calm while being completely terrified. Luckily, once the cameras began to roll and my interview started, I found myself speaking from the heart about what was important to me; the adrenaline subsided and I was no longer afraid. What had allowed me to release the terror, even for those few moments? I suspect that when my mind was focused on what was in my heart instead of all the fears from my past, I was able to experience myself as an unencumbered, non-suffering being. We need to confront terror from within.  We need to unmask the fear, to let go of pretending we have no fear. If we pretend to be unafraid, we can appear disinterested or disconnected from everyone and everything. At the same time, it doesnât work to try to unload the entire mass of fear inside at once. Rather, we can release terror moment by moment, bit by bit, by experiencing it in meditation.  Meditation assists me in seeing the roots of my fear, and in experiencing moments of being free from them. Often, those roots are very old. When I notice terror rising to the surface, I note, \"I am in the past.\" Then, I ask, \"What is going on here, right now?\" Other times, the roots are hidden.  When I am angry or enraged, I know to say, \"I am terrified of something.\" Most importantly, I refrain from being ashamed of experiencing these emotions. Only through acknowledging and releasing blind emotions can I experience the inner unencumbered and harmonious being that is always present despite the suffering.  Finally, in meditation we learn to cultivate moments of being unencumbered by fear.  We can experience them with each breath, moment by moment, breathing in and breathing out. In meditation we feel fear without having to do anything about it in the moment. We simply breathe. There is no past or future. We are not harming or being harmed. The terror within is being attended to in a gentle way. There may be tears or trembling. We are alive.

Even though, at last, many are now receiving vaccines, people over 70 remain at increased risk not only of Covid-19, but also of anxiety, depression and loneliness, due in part to social isolation. I have seen this firsthand. Sometimes, we have to take care of businessâother times, ourselves. One of the best âwisdom-remindersâ I ever received was from Sharon Salzberg, when I was on retreat with her in 2004. We spend a lot of our time leaning way forward into life, she said: with anticipation, excitement, anger, worry. We donât have to turn these emotions off, but we could just lean back a little bit.\n",

Unfortunately, depression extends to teens and young users as well, and researchers observed an increasing rate in the recent years (from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults), especially among girls and women. People themselves are a barrier to fight this disease as they tend to hide their symptoms and do not receive treatments. However, protected by anonymity, they share their sentiments on the Web, looking for help. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting depressed users in online forums. We analyze user behavior in the ReachOut.com online forum, a platform providing a supportive environment for young people to discuss their everyday issues, including depression. We examine the linguistic style of user posts in combination with network-based features modeling how users connect in the forum. Our results show that network features are strong predictors of depressed users and, by combining them with user post linguistic features, we can achieve an average precision of 0.78 (vs. 0.47 of a random classifier and 0.71 of linguistic features only) and perform better than related work (F1-measure of 0.63 vs. 0.50).

      "Depression is a complex medical condition. It can affect every aspect of a person’s life, from their personal relationships to their physical health. And of course, it impacts mental wellbeing.  But being unhappy isn’t the same as being depressed. Depression is a term often used loosely to describe how people feel after a bad week at work or when they’re going through a breakup. Clinical depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is more than feeling blue. Specific symptoms differentiate depression from the type of generalized sadness all people sometimes experience. In 2021, at least 8.3% of U.S. adults experienced a major depressive episode. Depression has become one of the most common mental health disorders in the country. In this article we cover eight signs of depression. The symptoms of depression tend to be more pervasive, severe, and debilitating for non-white individuals, who are more likely to be under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed when they have depression. Many do not get treated for the condition, and their symptoms grow even more intense as they get older. Research suggests that American Indians, Native Americans and Alaska Natives are the most likely to develop psychiatric disorders, including depression. This group lives with an enormous amount of post-traumatic stress, and members are more likely to engage in substance use disorders than people in other communities. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people (ages 8 to 24) in this demographic.Additional research suggests that white people are more likely to experience depression during their lifetimes (17.9% prevalence) than African-American individuals (10.4%). (Other data counters this, and finds that the latter group is more likely to experience depression, especially as its members age.) Socioeconomic factors, interpersonal issues, and concerns about racism tend to be major drivers of mental health for Black individuals.Depression is found to be less common among Asians, and more common among Hispanics and Latinx people.  The signs of depression may differ between racial and ethnic groups. Understanding these differences can help people and their healthcare professionals better identify and treat the condition. Determining whether persistent dark feelings are the result of depression can be the first step toward healing and recovery. The following signs indicate that it’s time to see a mental health professional. People who are depressed often experience feelings of hopelessness, though this is not the same across all races and ethnicities. Hispanic and Latino individuals are the most likely to report feeling hopeless “all or most of the time,” followed by people of two or more races, according to a recent National Health Interview Survey. Sometimes people who are depressed feel like they are worthless, a sentiment that the survey found most common among people of two or more races, as well as American Indians and Alaska Natives. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are most likely to feel like “everything is an effort, all the time,” followed by Black or African-American individuals. Some people who live with depression also experience inappropriate guilt. They may often think, “It’s all my fault,” or “What’s the point?” Loneliness and isolation are among the top three reasons people describe themselves as having poor mental health, as reported by more than 1 million people who screened themselves for depression and anxiety on Mental Health America’s website in 2020. For Hispanic/Latinx people, it was cited as the biggest cause of mental health issues. Depression can take the pleasure or enjoyment out of the things people love. A loss of interest in or withdrawal from activities that were previously looked forward to — sports, hobbies, going out with friends — is frequently a sign of major depression. In 2020, a whopping 90% of people who identified with more than one race reported symptoms of depression to Mental Health America. Another study of 25,503 older Americans found that Black and Hispanic individuals were 1.5 to 2 times more likely than white people to experience sadness and a loss of interest in everyday life. Losing interest in sex is common. Symptoms of major depression include a decreased sex drive and even impotence. Learn more about types of depression, symptoms, and causes. Part of the reason that people living with depression might stop doing things they enjoy is because they feel very tired. Depression often comes with a lack of energy and an overwhelming feeling of fatigue, which can be among its most debilitating symptoms. This can lead to excessive sleeping. Asian and Pacific Islander people (particularly those from older age groups) may report feeling tired or sleepy rather than depressed, as the latter can be seen as less culturally acceptable. Because these symptoms can be attributed to other conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, healthcare professionals may miss the true cause. Depression is also linked to insomnia, and they can feed off each other. A lack of restful sleep may lead to anxiety. Depression and anxiety often occur together. Symptoms of anxiety can include:  Native Americans and American Indians were most likely to report high levels of anxiety in Mental Health America’s 2020 screenings. Their rate of moderate to severe depression also increased sharply after 2019.  Depression can affect the sexes differently. Research shows that men with depression may also experience irritability, escapist or risky behavior, substance abuse, or misplaced anger. Overall, men are less likely than women to recognize depression or seek treatment for that condition. They are more likely to get help when their symptoms resemble “traditional” depression but may not identify their irritability or other strong feelings as something requiring treatment, according to a 2018 study.  Women are about twice as likely to take antidepressant medication as men, with the most frequent users being those over 60, according to the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. White people are also far more likely to take antidepressants than Black, Hispanic, or Asian individuals. Men, for their part, prefer medicine to talk therapy when they get treatment, a 2020 studyfound.  Weight and appetite can fluctuate for people with depression. This experience may be different for each person. Some people will have an increased appetite and gain weight, while others won’t be hungry and will lose weight.  One indication of whether dietary changes are related to depression is if they’re intentional or not. If they’re not, it may mean that they’re caused by depression. One moment it’s an outburst of anger. The next, tears are flowing uncontrollably. Depression can cause mood swings that fluctuate wildly, and it has nothing to do with anything outside of the person experiencing them.  Depression is sometimes connected to suicide. In 2020, nearly 46,000 people died from suicide in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Black people are less likely to die by suicide than white people, but Black teenagers are more likely to attempt suicide than white teenagers. Statisticians were surprised to note a significant decrease in the number of people who died by suicide in 2019 and 2020, after years of increases. In 2020 alone, the number of white females who died by suicide dropped 10%, while the number of white males doing so decreased 3%. The number of Asian men dying by suicide also dropped in 2020.At the same time, some groups saw increases. In 2020, the number of Hispanic men dying by suicide rose 5%, while the number of Black and American Indian men dying this way also rose. According to the CDC, American Indian and Native American people are far more likely to die by suicide than any other group, followed by white people. In Mental Health America’s online screenings, 46% of American Indians and Native Americans reported thinking about suicide or self-harm in 2020, and the number of those having such thoughts increased 7.5% over 2019. This reflected the largest jump in suicidal ideation from any racial or ethnic group surveyed. Those who die by suicide usually show symptoms of depression or mental health issues first. Often people will talk about it or make a first attempt before succeeding in ending their lives. When people are at immediate risk of self-harm or hurting others, those around them should: Depression affects millions of people, but there are myriad options available for treatment, from lifestyle changes to medications. No matter what path one follows, asking for professional help is a critical first step toward starting to feel better. What that help looks like may differ across communities of color and other marginalized groups. Because “traditional” depression symptoms can vary by race and ethnicity — and some people are reluctant to report their symptoms — often, individuals in these communities go undiagnosed.The reasons for anxiety and depression in each community also differ, and they are not static. In Mental Health America’s 2020 screenings, white people said coronavirus played the biggest role in negatively affecting their mental health. But Black people cited financial matters as a primary concern, while Hispanic/Latinx people were deeply affected by loneliness/isolation, and Native Americans impacted by trauma, loss, and relationship issues (also a major concern for Asian or Pacific Islanders). People in these racial and ethnic groups are typically less likely to be screened for depression and don’t receive mental healthcare treatment as often as those who are white.  Healthcare professionals who work with people experiencing depression must tailor their approach to address differences among those of varying ethnicities and races. Using a cultural accommodation model(CAM) may help bridge the gap. CAM helps these professionals adjust their viewfinder when diagnosing and treating conditions, urging them to be more culturally appropriate and sensitive to the unique characteristics of these populations.

      "You can take steps to cope with and navigate depression. Small changes to your daily routine, diet, and lifestyle habits can all positively affect you. Depression can drain your energy, leaving you feeling empty and fatigued. This can make it difficult to muster the strength or desire to get treatment. Small lifestyle changes may help you manage these feelings. If a person feels sustained, intense feelings of sadness or loss of interest in activities, they may have clinical depression. People also refer to this condition as major depressive disorder. But there are small steps you can take to help you gain more agency in your life and improve your sense of well-being. Read on to learn how to incorporate these strategies in a way that makes sense for you. Depression affects millions of people, including some in your life. You may not realize they face similar challenges, emotions, and obstacles. Being open, accepting, and loving toward yourself and what you’re going through may help you navigate depression. Every day with this disorder is different. It’s important to take your mental health seriously and accept that where you are right now isn’t where you’ll always be. On days when you feel you can’t get out of bed, exercise may seem like the last thing you’d want to do. But exercise and physical activity can help reduce symptoms of depression and improve energy levels. Research suggests that, for some people, exercise can be as effective as medication at relieving depression symptoms. It may also help prevent future depressive episodes. Even when you feel you’re unable to or have little energy, see if you’d be willing to do the opposite of what your mood tells you to do. Instead, set a small goal for yourself, such as walking around the block. Internal emotions and thoughts can change from day to day. Tracking experiences through journaling or keeping a mood diary can help you to remember this. If you were unsuccessful at getting out of bed or accomplishing goals today, remember that you haven’t lost tomorrow’s opportunity to try again. Give yourself the grace to accept that while some days will be difficult, others will also be less difficult. Try to look forward to tomorrow’s fresh start. Depression can tinge recollections with difficult emotions. You may find yourself focusing on things that are unhelpful or perceived as difficult. Try to stop this overgeneralization. Push yourself to recognize the good. If it helps, write down what was meaningful about the event or day. You can track what you achieved that day and which activities were enjoyable. Seeing the weight you’re giving to one thing may help you direct your thoughts away from the whole and to the individual pieces that were helpful. The automatic, unhelpful voice in your head may talk you out of self-help. But if you learn to recognize this voice, you can learn to work through it. If you believe an event won’t be fun or worth your time, say to yourself, “You might be right, but it’ll be better than just sitting here another night.” You may soon see that automatic thought isn’t always helpful. Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions: Learn more. Instead of compiling a long list of tasks, consider setting small goals. Setting and accomplishing these goals can provide a sense of control and accomplishment and help with motivation. Attainable goals may include: When you’ve done a small thing, set your eyes on another small thing, and then another. This way, you have a list of tangible achievements and not an untouched to-do list. All goals are worthy of recognition, and all successes are worthy of celebration. When you achieve a goal, do your best to recognize it. You may not feel like celebrating with a cake and confetti, but recognizing your own successes can be a powerful tool for depression’s negative weight. The memory of a job well done may be especially powerful against unhelpful self-talk and overgeneralization. If depressive symptoms disrupt your daily routine, a gentle schedule may help you feel in control. These plans don’t have to map out an entire day. Focus on creating a loose but structured routine to help you keep your daily pace. Depression can push you to give in to your fatigue. It may feel more powerful than preferred emotions. Try to push back and do something you love — something that’s pleasurable or meaningful. It could be playing an instrument, painting, hiking, or biking. Engaging in meaningful activities lifts your mood or energy, which can further motivate you to continue to engage in activities that help with navigating symptoms. Research shows music can improve your mood and symptoms of depression. It may also strengthen your reception of positive emotions. Music can be especially beneficial when performed in group settings, such as a musical ensemble or band.  You can also reap some of the same rewards simply by listening. Time in nature can have a powerful influence on a person’s mood. Research suggests that walks in nature may improve depressive symptoms in people with clinical depression. Time in natural spaces may improve mood and cognition and lower the risk of mental health disorders. But there’s only limited research on the direct effect of nature on those with clinical depression. Consider taking a walk at lunch among the trees or spending time in your local park. Or plan a weekend hike. These activities can help you reconnect with nature and soak in some rays at the same time. Depression can tempt you to isolate yourself and withdraw from people you love and trust, but face-to-face time can help wash away those tendencies. If you’re unable to spend time together in person, phone calls or video chats can also be helpful. Try to remind yourself these people care about you. Resist the temptation to feel like you’re a burden. You need the interaction — and they likely do too. Consider writing or journaling about what you’re experiencing. Then, when the feelings lift, write about that too. Research suggests that keeping a journal can be a beneficial add-on method for managing mental health conditions. Writing down your thoughts can help you express what you’re feeling more clearly. It can also help you keep track of your symptoms daily and identify their causes. You can make a goal to write for a few minutes each day or week. Most importantly, what you want to write about is completely up to you. When you do the same thing day after day, you use the same parts of your brain. Doing new things can feel rewarding and may improve your overall well-being and strengthen your social relationships. To reap these benefits, consider trying a new sport, creative class, or cooking technique. You can knock out a few birds with one stone — spending time with other people and doing something new — by volunteering and giving your time to someone or something else. You may be used to receiving help from friends, but reaching out and providing help may actually improve your mental health more. Bonus: People who volunteer experience physical benefits too. This includes a lowered risk of hypertension and improved sleep. When you do something you love, or even when you find a new activity you enjoy, you may be able to benefit your mental health more by taking time to be thankful for it. Practicing gratitude can have lasting positive effects on your overall mental health. What’s more, writing down your gratitude — including in notes to others — can be particularly meaningful. Stress and anxiety can prolong your depression symptoms. Finding relaxation techniques can help you lower stress and invite more joy and balance into your day. Research suggests that mindfulness activities may help you improve your sense of well-being and feel more connected to what’s happening around you. These activities can include: There’s no magic diet that will treat depression. But what you put into your body can have a real and significant effect on the way you feel. Some people also feel better and have more energy when they avoid sugar, preservatives, and processed foods. If you have the means, consider meeting with a doctor or registered dietitian for guidance. Eating a diet rich in lean meats, vegetables, and grains may be a great place to start. Try to limit stimulants such as caffeine, coffee, and soda and depressants such as alcohol. Substances such as drugs or alcohol can contribute to perpetuating feelings of sadness. On the other hand, people who live with addiction may experience symptoms of depression. You may want to consider limiting or avoiding the use of alcohol and other substances to help your depressive symptoms. Sleep disturbances are common with depression. You may not sleep well, or you may sleep too much. Both can make depression symptoms worse. Aim for 8 hours of sleep per night. Try to get into a healthy sleeping routine. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help you with your daily schedule. Getting the proper amount of sleep may also help you feel more balanced and energized throughout your day. Suppressing and compartmentalizing your feelings may seem like a strategic way to cope with the difficult symptoms of depression. But this technique is ultimately unhealthy and ineffective. If you’re having a down day, acknowledge it. Notice and name your emotions and try to bring your attention to engaging in activities that are helpful instead of focusing on the emotions. Seeing the ebb and flow of depressive symptoms can be instructive for both self-healing and hope. You may also find it helpful to speak with a professional about what you’re going through. A general practitioner may be able to refer you to a therapist or other specialist. They can assess your symptoms and help develop a clinical treatment plan tailored to your needs. This may include various options, such as medication and therapy. Finding the right treatment for you may take some time, so be open with a doctor or healthcare professional about what is and isn’t working. They’ll work with you to find the best option. For some people, the fastest way to reduce symptoms of depression may be to use prescribed medication. The type and dosage of medication may vary from person to person. Other methods that may help include talking with a mental health professional. You may also help reduce symptoms by taking a walk in nature or doing a calming activity. You may be able to relieve depression symptoms through therapy and some lifestyle changes, such as practicing mindfulness, getting regular exercise, and eating nutritious meals. In some cases, you may need medication to help. Treatment for depression can involve therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, lifestyle changes such as practicing meditation and limiting alcohol and drugs, and in some cases, taking medication. The best method for treating depression can vary depending on your needs and the severity of your symptoms. It can involve therapy, medication, and other practices that help you accept your own challenges and emotions.

      "Depression is one of the most common mood disorders in the United States. It causes persistent sadness and limits a person’s ability to go about their daily activities. However, depression is treatable, and people can recover from it. Both lifestyle changes and medical treatments can help individuals feel better. Typically, managing depression is an ongoing process. In this article, we list 16 strategies and treatments that can help fight depression. The more a person knows about depression, the more empowered they will be to find a treatment that works for them. It can be helpful to learn about depression in general, including its causes and symptoms. It is also important for people to get to know their own symptoms and warning signs so that if they are feeling worse, they can identify this. Knowing what prompts depressive episodes can help people avoid or manage triggers, which may reduce future depressive episodes. Educating friends and family members can also help, as loved ones can watch out for warning signs and be supportive when a person is having a difficult time. Reaching out to loved ones can help people get through difficult times. Simply talking about what is happening can help. Also, connecting with others helps reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation. If it does not feel possible to talk to a friend or family member, people may wish to join a support group or see a therapist. Keeping a journal is a powerful strategy for fighting depression. Writing down thoughts, feelings, and problems can allow individuals to identify patterns, triggers, and warning signs relating to their depression. It can also give people perspective on particular issues and help them generate solutions. Writing things down can be especially helpful before bed, especially if distressing thoughts are hindering sleep. If people do not feel comfortable keeping a journal due to privacy concerns, they can destroy the paper afterward. Some people find the act of writing itself cathartic. Another journaling option is to make a list of things for which a person is grateful. Researchers noted positive effects on the brain in people who kept such a list. People sometimes refer to this as keeping a gratitude journal. Seeing a doctor for diagnosis and treatment is an important part of treating depression. A doctor can provide support, guidance, and medical treatment options. Depending on the individual’s symptoms and their wishes, a doctor may prescribe medication or recommend psychotherapy. Anyone experiencing severe depression should see a doctor as soon as possible, while thoughts of suicide should prompt a person to call 911 or contact the National Suicide Prevention Line on 800-273-8266. If you know someone at immediate risk of self-harm, suicide, or hurting another person: If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, a prevention hotline can help. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 988. During a crisis, people who are hard of hearing can use their preferred relay service or dial 711 then 988. Find more links and local resources. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, can be highly effective for depression. Depending on the type of therapy, it may help people: Doctors commonly recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. Research suggests that CBT can help treat depression, and it may be an effective alternative to medication in some cases. Other types of therapy, including interpersonal therapy and psychodynamic therapy, can also help people with depression. Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment. It stops people from concentrating on the past or worrying about the future. Anyone can practice mindfulness at any time, but some people may find it helpful to begin by using an app or attending a class. Recent research from 2019 links mindfulness practices with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Pairing mindfulness with CBT in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes as effectively as maintenance antidepressant medications. People who treat the mind and body as separate entities may have a more careless attitude about health and well-being than those who connect the two. Many alternative practitioners believe that connecting the mind and body is essential for overall physical and mental health. The following practices connect the mind and body, which could help people feel better and practice more healthful behaviors: Physical activity can release endorphins that improve mood, and research indicates that exercise is effective in treating the symptoms of major depression. Even though exercise may be the last thing that many people feel like doing when they are going through a depressive episode, it can often be helpful. A person can start slowly, such as by going for a short walk or swim once or twice a week. A 2018 study looked at whether exercise could help reduce depression symptoms when people were already receiving therapy and antidepressant medication. The results showed that 75% of the participants who also exercised experienced fewer or a complete remission of symptoms compared with 25% of the participants who did not exercise. The results also suggested that exercise improved biomarkers of depression and reduced associated sleep problems. Food has a significant effect on mood and mental health. Deficiencies in some nutrients, including omega-3s and iron, have links to depression. Eating a balanced, nutritious diet can help prevent deficiencies and keep a person feeling physically well, which can support mental health. Most of a person’s calories should come from: Alcohol and recreational drugs make the symptoms of depression much worse. They can also make the condition harder to treat. People who struggle to avoid these substances may wish to consider speaking to a doctor or therapist. Some supplements may be beneficial when people with depression take them as part of a treatment plan. However, it is vital to speak to a doctor before taking supplements. Some may interact with antidepressants or other medications, or they may be unsuitable for people who are pregnant or have existing medical conditions. Examples of supplements that people sometimes take for depression include: Learn more about supplements and herbs for depression in this article. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed contributes to feelings of depression. Taking time out to relax can mitigate some of the effects of stress and help restore a person’s energy. Every day, try scheduling at least a few minutes of relaxation time. Relaxing means different things for different people. Some options include: Setting goals and targets can sometimes help when a person is feeling demotivated. However, it is important to make sure that goals are achievable, specific, and realistic. People may also wish to set a time frame around achieving each goal. For example, instead of saying, “I will start to exercise more,” a person can make specific, actionable goals, such as, “I will go for a 15-minute walk tomorrow morning before work.” Breaking down larger goals into smaller steps using these same principles can also help when a person is going through depression. For example, instead of planning to clean the kitchen, decide to empty the trash, and fill the dishwasher. Once those tasks are complete, a person can choose to set more if they feel up to it. Volunteering for a worthy cause can come with a myriad of mental health benefits. Research indicates that people who volunteer may enjoy better mental and physical health, fewer depressive symptoms, and less psychological distress. They may also have higher life satisfaction, self-esteem, and happiness. To find a volunteering opportunity, people can approach local organizations or look online on websites such as Volunteer Match. Regular, quality sleep is essential for mental health. Too much or too little sleep can be a symptom of depression when it occurs along with other symptoms, such as prolonged feelings of sadness. Aim to sleep for 7–9 hours each night and to go to bed and get up at the same time each day. Try to unwind before bed with a set routine, such as having a warm bath, drinking chamomile tea, or reading. The results of a 2013 study suggest that getting out in nature can provide an important boost to mental health. Part of this effect may be due to the fact that time outdoors increases a person’s exposure to sunlight, which increases serotonin and vitamin D levels. The study found that people who walked in nature had elevated moods compared with those who walked in a city environment. In an urban environment, people deal with increased noise, advertising, and traffic, which can all be stressors. Being in nature may, therefore, be more restorative. Consider spending more time outdoors in the following ways: Depression is a treatable mood disorder. People can recover from depressive episodes with lifestyle changes, coping strategies, talk therapy, or medications. For most people, a combination of these methods is necessary. It is vital to see a doctor if symptoms of depression persist for 2 weeks or more. A doctor can provide a diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan. To maintain recovery from depression, it is essential to treat mental health in the same way as physical health — by working on it on an ongoing basis.

      "Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time. Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work. Depression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression. Women are more likely to have depression than men. An estimated 3.8% of the population experience depression, including 5% of adults (4% among men and 6% among women), and 5.7% of adults older than 60 years. Approximately 280 million people in the world have depression (1). Depression is about 50% more common among women than among men. Worldwide, more than 10% of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression (2). More than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds. Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, more than 75% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment (3). Barriers to effective care include a lack of investment in mental health care, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders.  During a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of pleasure or interest in activities. A depressive episode is different from regular mood fluctuations. They last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Other symptoms are also present, which may include: Depression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including in the community and at home, work and school. A depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the impact on the individual’s functioning.  There are different patterns of depressive episodes including: Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person’s life situation and the depression itself. Depression is closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the factors that influence depression (such as physical inactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing depression due to the difficulties associated with managing their condition. Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression. Effective community approaches to prevent depression include school-based programmes to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents. Interventions for parents of children with behavioural problems may reduce parental depressive symptoms and improve outcomes for their children. Exercise programmes for older persons can also be effective in depression prevention. There are effective treatments for depression. These include psychological treatment and medications. Seek care if you have symptoms of depression. Psychological treatments are the first treatments for depression. They can be combined with antidepressant medications in moderate and severe depression. Antidepressant medications are not needed for mild depression. Psychological treatments can teach new ways of thinking, coping or relating to others. They may include talk therapy with professionals and supervised lay therapists. Talk therapy can happen in person or online. Psychological treatments may be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps.  Effective psychological treatments for depression include:    Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences.  Antidepressants should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with extra caution. Different medications and treatments are used for bipolar disorder.  Self-care can play an important role in managing symptoms of depression and promoting overall well-being. What you can do: If you have thoughts of suicide: If you think you are in immediate danger of harming yourself, contact any available emergency services or a crisis line. WHO’s Mental health action plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental disorders including depression.  Depression and self-harm/suicide are among the priority conditions covered by WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The Programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health.  WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals for depression that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. An example is the Problem management plus (PM+) manual, which describes the use of behavioural activation, stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support. Moreover, the Group interpersonal therapy for depression manual describes group treatment of depression. Finally, the Thinking healthy manual covers the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy for perinatal depression.   References   Related Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)  More on depression  Videos Fact sheets More          \n",

      "While everyone has experienced sadness, not everyone has experienced depression. In fact, if you’ve never been depressed, chances are that you don’t have a real grasp on what living with this complex mental illness is like. Depression is insidious. It affects not only your mood, but also your ability to feel, think, and function. It blunts sensations of pleasure, closes off connectedness, stifles creativity, and, at its worst, shuts down hope. It also often causes deep emotional pain not only to the person experiencing it, but to that person’s close family and friends. If sadness alone isn’t a good gauge of depression, what is? According to the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is the diagnostic guide used by most mental health professionals, if you’ve experienced at least five of the following symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression. No one knows for sure why some people become depressed and others do not. Depression can occur spontaneously, without any obvious cause. And it’s well documented that once you’ve had one depressive episode, your risk of having another later in life increases. Psychiatrists today generally look at depression in “bio-psycho-social” terms, meaning that they see it as a complex disorder most likely triggered by overlapping biological, psychological, and social (also referred to as environmental) factors, according to a study published in August 2019 in Psychiatric Times. Among the potential contributors to depression are: To be diagnosed with MDD, one of your symptoms must be a persistent low mood or a loss of interest or pleasure, the DSM-5 states. Your symptoms must also not be due to substance abuse or a medical condition, such as thyroid problems, a brain tumor, or a nutritional deficiency. Of course, it’s normal to have any or all of these symptoms temporarily (for hours or even days) from time to time. The difference with depression is that the symptoms persist and make it difficult to function normally. If you suspect you may be depressed, the best first step is to reach out to your primary care doctor, a psychiatrist, or a psychotherapist. Also, know that depression screenings may now be a part of routine checkups. As of June 2023, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that primary care providers screen all adults for depression, including pregnant and postpartum people and older adults. If you’re reluctant to consult a professional, type “depression” or “clinical depression” into Google on your cellphone or computer and you’ll find links to a clinically validated depression test known as the PHQ-9 patient health questionnaire. Although designed to be administered by a healthcare professional, this test is short and straightforward. Take it and you can immediately see if your score indicates you may have depression. Important: If you suspect you have depression, or if you’re feeling troubled by your symptoms, have suicidal thoughts, just need to talk, want some advice, or need a referral for treatment, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) at the three-digit code 988, or the National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Both are free and available 24/7, 365 days a year. Learn More About Depression Symptoms In addition to MDD, there are several other kinds of depression, including: Learn More About Perinatal Depression Learn More About SAD Learn More About Bipolar Disorder Learn More About Postpartum Depression One reason depression can be hard to identify is that its signs can vary widely from person to person and sometimes be masked by atypical symptoms. For example, some people who are depressed may show it by acting disgruntled, resentful, or irritable. In fact, aggression — including outright acts of violence — can be indicative of “hidden” depression, according to a report published in February 2017 in Psychiatric Times. Depression masquerading as anger may seem surprising at first, but not when you consider that several underlying factors, including alcohol or substance abuse and childhood trauma, have been linked to both. Similarly, although it’s not clear why, a person who experiences anxiety is at high risk for developing depression, and vice versa. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that as many as 60 percent of people with anxiety will also have symptoms of depression; the same goes for people with depression having symptoms of anxiety. Experts say there is often a genetic predisposition for these co-occurring disorders, according to Hartgrove Behavioral Health System. Depression may also manifest psychosomatically, meaning that instead of presenting first and foremost as a mood disorder, the dominant symptom may be things like vague aches, dizziness, headaches, digestive problems, or back pain, according to a review published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Complicating matters is that it’s often hard to know whether depression is causing the physical symptoms, or if the physical symptoms are causing depression. How long depression lasts varies from person to person, but according to the DSM-5, a depressive episode lasts at least two weeks. Untreated depressive episodes appear to last 6 to 12 months, according to StatPearls. Depression also tends to be chronic, with episodes happening again in about half of people who’ve experienced one depressive episode, 70 percent of people who’ve had two episodes, and 90 percent of people who’ve had three episodes. But some people never experience another episode after the first one. If you suspect that depression is interfering with your life, talking about what you’re experiencing and discussing treatment options with a medical professional is essential. As actress Taraji P. Henson, who describes her depression as “suffocating” darkness, recently explained in an interview with Self, “When you’re quiet, things aren’t fixed. It gets worse.” The good news is that there’s abundant evidence that people with depression who seek treatment will find significant relief from talk therapy (psychotherapy), medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of all efforts, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The Society of Clinical Psychology rates several types of psychotherapy as highly effective treatments for depression: The most commonly prescribed antidepressants cause changes in brain chemistry that affect how neurons communicate. Exactly how this improves mood remains somewhat of a mystery, but the fact that they do often work is well-established. If you’re thinking about trying antidepressants, talk to your doctor about whether these treatments could be right for you. All antidepressants can have side effects, but some may be more problematic than others. You may need to try several different medications, or a combination, guided by your doctor, before you find what works best for you. In addition, it may take some patience before you see results. The full benefits of the drugs may not be realized until you’ve taken them for as long as three months, according to the the STAR*D trial, the largest, longest study on antidepressant treatment, which ended in 2006. Sometimes, other medications may be added to your regimen, depending on the form of depression, severity of your symptoms, and your response to other therapies. These might include a mood stabilizer, such as lithium (sold under several brand names) or valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). If symptoms of psychosis (having delusions or seeing or hearing voices that are not real, for example) are present, a doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic medication, such as haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and olanzapine (Zyprexa). Some experts believe that using an antipsychotic in combination with an antidepressant may be more effective for depressive disorders than antidepressants alone, according to a review published in Shanghai Archives of Psychiatry. Learn More About Depression Treatment Lifestyle changes, such as making art, journaling, exercising more, and practicing yoga or mindfulness, can also alleviate depression and the stress that can heighten it. Alternative treatments like massage, acupuncture, and light therapy may also help. Diet changes, too, can uplift your mood by reducing inflammation and helping to ensure your brain gets the nutrients it needs to function at its best. One small randomized controlled study, published October 9, 2019, in the journal PLoS One, found that self-reported symptoms of depression dropped significantly in just three weeks in young adults who changed from a highly processed, high-carbohydrate diet to a Mediterranean diet focused on vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, unsweetened dairy, nuts and seeds, olive oil, and the spices turmeric and cinnamon. In contrast, the depression scores didn’t budge in a control group of people who didn’t change their diet. No, but it’s easy to see why some people might think so, because of a medical condition called antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), which can occur if you abruptly stop taking medication rather than tapering off as is generally advised. ADS is marked by a wide range of responses, including but not limited to flu-like symptoms, insomnia, worsening mood, and stomach distress, according to a report published March 11, 2019, in Psychiatric Times. Current estimates are that up to 40 percent of patients who’ve taken an antidepressant for at least a month will experience ADS symptoms if they abruptly stop their medication instead of lowering their dose gradually, according to a study published December 2018 in The American Journal of Psychiatry. (Conversely, more than 60 percent of patients who stop taking an SSRI will have no significant symptoms.) Tapering under the care of a doctor can prevent ADS by allowing the brain to adjust to changes in neurotransmitter levels. More to the point, while you should slowly stop your antidepressant with the help of your doctor, antidepressants do not cause dependence and withdrawal like other substances. Unlike substances that are known to cause addiction, such as alcohol, opioids, and barbiturates, people don't crave antidepressants. You don’t get “high” from them, and they aren’t intentionally or compulsively overused. Serious reactions like the seizures and agitation that can follow sudden withdrawal from addictive substances are “unheard of when these antidepressants are tapered gradually,” note the authors of the Psychiatric Times report. If you’ve tried at least two different antidepressants and your depression hasn’t improved, you may be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). TRD is a serious condition that has been highly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Thirty percent of people with TRD attempt suicide in their lifetime, more than double the rate of their treatment-responsive peers, according to a review published in April 2018 in the Journal of Affective Disorders. It is not, however, a hopeless condition. A number of alternative treatment approaches are available, including: If you’re wondering how to prevent depression, unfortunately there’s no surefire way. But according to Mayo Clinic, these steps could help: Try your best to curb stress in your life. Depression can worsen and take a significant toll on your mental and physical health if it’s not properly treated, according to Mayo Clinic. Potential complications of depression include: Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who know exactly what it means to be depressed. In 2020, an estimated 21 million, or 8.4 percent, of adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, making it one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States. What’s more, a recent report from Mental Health America, a nonprofit founded in 1909, offers startling statistics pertaining to one of depression's most disturbing symptoms: thoughts of suicide. According to its 2023 State of Mental Health in America report, suicidal ideation among adults has reached 4.84 percent (more than 12.1 million people). There is a bright side. Although there is no one-size-fits-all cure for depression, there are many effective treatment options, one of which is bound to help you heal if you’re struggling with the illness. This cannot be emphasized enough, given that roughly two-thirds of people living with depression do not receive the care they need, according to a report published online February 22, 2019, in the journal Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment. When it comes to depression, there is a distinct gender gap. Depression is nearly twice as common in women as in men, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Hormonal and other biological factors play a role in this disparity. After all, only cisgender women and people with a uterus can have premenstrual or postpartum depression. The same is true of antepartum (or perinatal) depression — depression during pregnancy — which the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates affects 1 in 10 pregnant women. Research on depression within communities of color has revealed a number of differences in the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment between people of color and white communities. The symptoms of depression may appear differently among people of color compared with white people, according to the study from February 2019 in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment. For instance, while white people are more likely to have acute depressive episodes, African American people are more likely to experience depression that’s more chronic, prolonged, and debilitating. In another study, published in December 2022 in Nursing Research, which was focused primarily on Black and African American mothers, participants were more likely to report self-blame, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and an inability to experience pleasure than some of the hallmark symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness or sadness. Importantly, the authors of the study noted, traditional depression screening tools may not capture these symptoms, meaning depression may go undetected in some Black and African American women. Among Black and Hispanic people, major depression goes undiagnosed and is undertreated at a much greater rate than among white people, according to a report published in May 2022 by Blue Cross Blue Shield. When these communities do receive treatment, prescription medication and counseling are utilized less often than in white communities, the report noted. When it comes to treatment, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities are the least likely racial group to seek professional mental health services, according to Mental Health America. That’s often due to factors like a lack of accessible resources, language barriers, and cultural stigmas surrounding mental health issues. Learn More About Suicide Risk and Prevention When your provider evaluates you for depression, it’s important that they rule out any other potential conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Conditions that may overlap with MDD, according to StatPearls, include: Importantly, some people may have at least one of the above conditions in addition to depression, according to research published in February 2015 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Having multiple mental health conditions at the same time is what’s known as psychiatric comorbidity.

      "Learn about the symptoms of different mental health conditions and what you can do to tackle them. What do I do if I feel sad? Sadness can be a difficult emotion to deal with. It can be the result of loss, helplessness, or disappointment, among many other things. Sadness is one of the most common and natural human emotions, however sometimes it is possible for sadness to deepen, and this may be a sign that you are suffering from a form of depression. If you feel as though you are increasingly sad, and feel like your sadness is difficult to explain, this information on depression may help.  Interested in learning more? You can also check out our practical, self-paced online program that teaches step-by-step strategies for tackling symptoms of depression.  It is normal to experience feelings of sadness and despair in response to life events such as loss, major life changes, stress, or disappointment. In most cases, the sad feelings resolve as you come to terms with the changes in your life. In situations such as loss, these feelings may persist for months and return at significant times, such as birthdays and anniversaries related to the lost loved one. However, if you have times when you can enjoy things, this sadness is not a sign of depression.  Depression is a disorder that is characterised by excessive sadness, loss of interest in enjoyable things, and low motivation.  Depression is common. One in three people will experience an episode of major depression at some stage in their lives. While most cases of depression are mild, about one in ten people will have a moderate or severe episode.  Any of these features may be warning signs of depression. You need to be experiencing at least five of these symptoms for at least two weeks to be considered as having a depressive disorder. Remember, only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose depression following a thorough assessment of your personal situation and circumstances. If you’re concerned about the way you’ve been feeling, please don’t delay speaking with your regular healthcare provider. You can also check out our anonymous online test and see if one of our online programs could help.  Not Sure Whether to Seek Help?

No one knows exactly what causes depression. Genetic factors are important in many cases of depression, where depression seems to run in families (as do other mood disorders), and about 30% of the vulnerability for depression is due to  genetic influences.   Stressful life events  also play a part in depression. Ongoing conflicts with others can take their toll on our wellbeing, as can other social and environmental stressors such as financial difficulties, retirement, unemployment, childbirth, loneliness, or loss of someone or something important. In vulnerable people, these stressful life events may be enough to cause or worsen depression.  Personality style is another important factor. When people are depressed, they usually have a very negative view of themselves and the world. They do not appreciate good things, and bad things seem overwhelming. Some people have a tendency to view themselves and the world this way even when they are not depressed. In other words, they may have a depressive personality style.  Other possible causes of depression that should not be overlooked is  physical illness or medications. Glandular fever, influenza, hepatitis, thyroid hormones, anaemia, diabetes, birth control pills, alcohol and substances of abuse, or certain medications such as those for heart or blood pressure conditions, may all cause symptoms of depression.  There are a range of ways to deal with depression, and often they are best used in conjunction with each other. The top medical options are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), antidepressant medication, and in some severe cases, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT).  Psychoeducation is also important when learning to manage your depression.   Take a look below to find out more about each option:  Psychoeducation refers to learning about the way depression develops and is maintained. Education for people with depression is extremely valuable. Education provides a knowledge base that can give the person greater control over their disorder. Greater control in turn may lead to reduced feelings of helplessness and an increased sense of wellbeing. Providing education for families or carers is also very important to help increase the support and assistance they provide to the person.  The most essential pieces of information for a person with a depression are that depression is a common disorder and that effective treatments are available. It is important to remember:  CBT is a proven treatment for depression, alone or in conjunction with medication. CBT is very effective and 80% of people with mild, moderate or severe depression improve. CBT involves learning to:   CBT will often be recommended when:    Click here to see if our online CBT course can help you tackle your depression to improve the way you feel.  For some people, antidepressant medication will be the first line of treatment for the elimination of severe depression, however it would be unadvisable to manage very severe depression without a trial of medication. For mild to moderate depression, antidepressant medications are not often recommended as a first line of treatment.  Different antidepressant medications work in different ways. You may need to trial more than one type to find the medication that works best for you. Make sure to keep in close contact with your prescribing physician during the early stages of taking medications as the side effects can often be difficult to deal with.  Some things to remember when taking antidepressant medications are:  ECT is an effective form of treatment for depression, especially if: ECT involves the application of a brief electric current to carefully selected sites on the scalp. These electric currents, which are administered by a psychiatrist and anaesthetist, produce a minor seizure in the brain. Prior to the procedure, the person is given a short-acting general anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant to reduce awareness of the procedure and to prevent a physical seizure. Although many people are fearful of ECT, this technique is arguably the safest and most effective medical treatment for severe depression, although there can be some memory related side effects. ECT works more quickly than antidepressant drugs and CBT.  You can also use antidepressants and CBT alongside ECT, as they can help prevent relapse after ECT is completed. What is CBT? Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or CBT is one of the most effective psychological treatments for depression. CBT uses cognitive and behavioural strategies to help target the thoughts, feelings and behaviours associated with depression. All of our online programs use CBT strategies.   Click below to see if our online CBT program can help you tackle your depression to improve the way you feel.  People who are depressed generally have a negative thinking style. They often think of themselves as worthless and that the world is bad or unfair, and they have little hope that their lives will improve in the future.  When something bad happens, people with depression often blame themselves, but when good things happen, they tell themselves they are just lucky. They are also less likely to recognise and appreciate positive events when they happen, and instead are more tuned into the bad things in their lives and brood over those events.  The cognitive strategies in CBT can help people identify and correct this biased way of thinking. These strategies identify and challenge sometimes hidden assumptions and beliefs, and can reframe the way they think about life. When people with depression are able to reframe their thoughts, they are able to recover from failures more effectively and recognise and take credit for the good things in their lives. Having these skills has been shown to reduce relapse and a recurrence of depression.  A key feature of depression is low activity. People with depression do less than they normally would, and feel worse because of this. Behavioural strategies for depression aim to identify and change behaviours such as low activity that may worsen depression.  One of the advantages of this strategy is that once acquired, these new behaviours can be applied throughout life, and help to prevent relapse. Behavioural strategies for depression include:  The symptoms of depression can be addressed to help you feel better. Here are some ways to deal with some individual symptoms: Eat small portions of food that you particularly like. Take your time and do not feel under pressure to finish if you are eating with others. Drink plenty of fluids. Seek nonsexual activities with your partner that you still enjoy.

      "9 Self-Help Solutions for Reducing Symptoms of Depression   Being depressed is painful and debilitating. An estimated 10 percent of adults in the United States suffer from symptoms of depression each year, resulting in family strife, loss of work productivity, and misery for the person affected by the condition and those around them. While getting professional medical help for depression is always a good idea, especially if the condition is severe, there are also many non-medical solutions a person can take on their own to reduce symptoms of depression. Many therapists and doctors advise that depressed patients take steps like these, along with counseling and medication. Here are nine ways a depressed person can engage in self-help to overcome or reduce the symptoms of mild to moderate depression.   1. Get Some Exercise Many scientific studies on depression find that exercise is as useful for relieving mild to moderate depression as medication.  Exercise has multiple positive benefits beyond helping with depression symptoms such as improved cardiovascular health, weight loss, and reduced risk for developing many chronic diseases. It can be quite challenging to exercise when feeling depressed, so it is best to start small and do something enjoyable. Taking a short walk each day, doing ten minutes of calisthenics at home, or putting on some music and dancing are all suitable types of exercise for reducing depression. Exercise helps with the symptoms of depression because it increases brain chemicals called endorphins. Even a few minutes a day of mild exercise can improve mood by elevating endorphin levels.   2. Challenge Negative Thoughts When someone is depressed, they often engage in negative thinking. Thoughts such as, \"I'm a failure,\"  \"No one likes me,\" or \"I'll always feel this way,\" are common in a depressed person's mind. Negative thoughts like these become an unconscious habit, reinforcing the feeling of depression. A simple solution is challenging negative thoughts with positive thinking. For example, a challenge to the idea \"I'll always feel this way.\" might be, \"How do I know that?\" or by thinking of a time when you did feel differently about life. We often accept our thoughts as real without challenging them. However, there is much wisdom in the saying, \"Don't believe everything you think.\"   3. Regularly Eat Wholesome Foods When a person is depressed, they often tend to eat poorly. Sugary, salty, and high-fat junk food can bring a temporary feeling of comfort, but ultimately these foods cause spikes in blood sugar, weight gain, and bring on bad moods. The solution is finding wholesome foods you like, making sure you have plenty on hand, and eating these foods every day. Fresh fruit, salads, lean meats, oily fish such as salmon, and whole-grain bread are all good options, as long as you do not have a food allergy or another adverse reaction to the food. The critical point is finding wholesome foods you enjoy and training yourself to reach for these when hungry or feeling down.   4. Get Adequate Sleep Both depression and anxiety can contribute to insomnia, which could include difficulty falling and staying asleep. Making changes in your routine may help with getting a more restful sleep throughout the night.   For example:   Sleep is vital for our brain and body to regenerate, repair, and renew. Getting a good night's sleep each night improves overall health and energy levels, which can reduce symptoms of depression.   5. Drink Plenty of Water Water is essential for all bodily functions. Drinking an adequate amount of water daily assists the body in removing toxins, improves the function of internal organs, and even enhances clear thinking. Many people do not drink enough water and instead fill up on soft drinks, caffeinated beverages, and alcoholic drinks. These types of beverages cause the body to lose water, leading to dehydration.   If drinking plain water is a challenge, consider these alternatives:   For optimal health, adults need about two to three quarts of liquid a day beyond what they get from food. Keeping your body healthy helps reduce feelings of depression.   6. Make a Change in Routine When a person is depressed, they often get into a routine that reinforces the symptoms of depression. For example, a depressed person may get up, go to work, come home, watch the same shows on TV each night, and then binge on unhealthy foods before going to bed.  A schedule like this can keep a person feeling bad about themselves. Making a change in routine does not need to be complicated. For example, instead of heading straight for the TV after getting home from work, commit to taking a short walk first. Instead of having an unhealthy dinner, make a small effort to eat a more healthy meal. Changing routines can help to rewire the pathways of dopamine in the brain, an important brain chemical linked to feelings of happiness. The changes in routine do not need to be large to have a positive effect.   7. Get a Routine For some depressed people, the problem is not having enough of a routine and structure to their day. In this case, establishing a more structured routine can be of benefit in alleviating the symptoms of depression.   Building a healthy new routine can be simple. For example, simply getting up and getting dressed in the morning rather than lounging around in pajamas is a small, but potentially significant change to daily habits. Other ideas are calling friend each day, taking a short walk, writing in a journal, or spending half an hour listening to pleasurable music. Establishing new habits and routines also increases dopamine levels, which can reduce feelings of depression.   8. Laughter Laughing is another method for increasing dopamine in the brain. Sitting down and watching comedy shows or movies, reading jokes, laughing with others, or merely thinking about amusing things that result in laughter can all boost dopamine levels and help with symptoms of depression.   9. Help Someone Else There is a strong tendency when we are depressed to become self-absorbed. Our problems loom large in our minds, adding to the feeling of being overwhelmed. A simple solution is to do something helpful for another person or to take care of a pet animal. Calling a friend to ask how they are doing, volunteering at a local charity, helping a neighbor with yard work, or adopting a pet are only a few examples. When we help others, it raises our self-esteem, and we also get our minds off of our troubles. Any reprieve from depressed feelings can assist in improving positive thinking and elevating mood.     Starting these self-help actions may seem challenging at first to a depressed person. However, making even a small change each day can quickly build momentum and increase energy as symptoms of depression begin to subside. Taking small, daily steps toward a healthier life can have a significant effect on the reduction of mild to moderate symptoms of depression.    © Copyright 2024 Tebra Inc.

Attending social events when you can and finding new hobbies that could help you meet new people can all help you build new relationships, too.  Have you ever walked into a cereal aisle and been suddenly unsure which one you wanted to buy? Researchers think that having too many choices can actually cause significant stress that can lead to depression.  The psychologist Barry Schwartz, author of the book “The Paradox of Choice,” describes research that shows that when faced with too many choices, those who aim to make the best possible choice — “maximizers” — face higher rates of depression.  For many of us, our lives are filled with choices. Which outfit do we wear, and should we buy yogurt, eggs, bagels, English muffins, or sausage for breakfast? The pressure of making the right — or wrong — choice is thought to contribute to depression. If making choices stresses you out, simplify things. You can: Chronic stress is one of the most avoidable common causes of depression. Learning how to manage and cope with stress is essential to improve mental health.

Sometimes, they’re an outright bully and other times, they subtly put us down to make themselves feel better. They may even be someone who takes advantage of us.  Surrounding yourself with supportive people is important, but knowing when to distance yourself from those who contribute to your stress can make a difference as well.  One study from 2012 found that negative social interactions were linked to higher levels of two proteins known as cytokines. These two proteins are associated with inflammation, as well as depression. Research has shown that regularly consuming a high fat diet can have effects similar to those of chronic stress when it comes to causing depression. In addition, an unhealthy diet can also deprive your body of vital nutrients it needs to maintain physical and mental health.  To minimize the chances of worsening depression with your diet, consider: If a doctor has given you specific diet guidelines for your health situation, be sure to follow those.  Weight fluctuations due to stress and depression can result in low self-esteem, especially once you start adding in the judgments and criticisms of other people — for many, this can become a vicious cycle. Public health experts have found a clear correlation between being overweight or underweight and experiencing depression.  Exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and eating well should help with maintaining a healthy weight. If you’re finding it difficult to manage your weight as a result of depression, consider speaking with a doctor or therapist.

      " There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Read more about exercise for depression It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing.

Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you support and an insight into your own depression. You may not feel comfortable about discussing your mental health and sharing your distress with others. If this is the case, writing about how you feel or expressing your emotions through poetry or art are other ways to help your mood. Here's a list of depression support groups and information about how to access them. If you have depression it may be tempting to smoke or drink to make you feel better.

If you see any of the above warning signs in a friend or relative: If you feel there's an immediate danger, call 999 or take them to A&E. Stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of attempting suicide, such as medicine. Over-the-counter medicine, such as painkillers, can be just as dangerous as prescription medicine. Also, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach. Someone may be at increased risk when they start or change their antidepressant treatment, or when they're facing particularly stressful situations.
