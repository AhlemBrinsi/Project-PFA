I'm attempting to develop a model capable of analyzing human emotions using web pages as the dataset. However, regardless of my efforts, the test accuracy remains consistently stagnant and significantly distant from the training accuracy, with both being too low (under 20%). I'm seeking insights on how to address this issue. Thank you.

This project is part of my second year of engineering studies.
